1,"I don’t attempt to keep track but I’ve been depressed for about 2 years now, and i think by definition ‘suicidal’ but i dont know if you really get in the cool kids club if you dont cut or youve never tried to kill yourself. Every day I’m always thinking about how much of a piece of shit i am and how worthless and valueless I am and I figure since its not a matter of beliefs but a matter of fact that itd be a waste to bother my family with how I’m really feeling, and have them get some kind of therapist to tell me the learned bullshit about things getting better and people really loving me. But i’ve never attempted suicide because i’m always stopped by the horrifying thought that one of my family members, particularly my mom or little sister finding my dead body and having that burned into their minds forever. And it’s frustrating in a way because i KNOW I’m worthless. Again, this is a fact. I don’t do anything. Everybody else has a job or is at least attractive or fit or whatever and i’m just nothing, i’m a rotund rectangle who sits in a chair for about 6 hours every day then goes to sleep and wakes up at 12 am and pm. They try to convince me I actually have something to live for because i got a 30 on the act! Yaaaaay! Fucking superb. What a joy it’ll be when i either still end up doing worse than both my brothers who the test claims are dumber than me or i do get a high paying job of some kind working in a poorly lit depressing office since my only two transferrable skills are math and writing and i fucking hate both. And not only that, but i cant stop thinking about other people dying. I couldnt be fucked to care about my oldest brother or my step-dad, and i could probably at least overcome the emotional pain of losing my brother or little sister but i’ll be a fucking mess whenever my mom passes away. She’s perfectly healthy but recently she keeps talking about how old she is. And she isn’t, she’s 48 which is NOT old, and i remind her of that every time but it actually breaks my heart (and as i was writing this just now, i just completely broke down in tears which is notable for me because i haven’t shed a tear at all for over a year.) (and as i thought about it more i cried a whooole lot more) because in what might be my best years with her and the one thing keeping me from committing suicide are years where she wont be happy. And since i’m writing this essay about how i’m extra suicidal because my mom’s just gonna get worse and worse and her health will ACTUALLY decline, it means that the one person keeping me alive right now is alao the reason i cant WAIT to die. Theres no way I win. I stay alive, i’ve pretty much gotten over the hump of her good years or are currently going over it and itll only get worse and she’ll age and become unrecognizable and even more miserable. I die right now, i remember her at her best which is a time when she’s convinced herself she’s 30 years older than she is and she isn’t happy and on top of it she’s gonna have to live with the embarrassment and possible guilt of her child committing suicide. I hatw this. I hate this so fucking much. There’s no way out",S
2,"I had a plan.  It was a good plan.  But now the reason for implementing the plan is gone.  It's all gone.  It was the very purpose of my life.  I feel like a Meeseeks (from Rick &amp; Morty) who was given a specific purpose to accomplish only to have it become literally impossible before he could, like asking him to give me and ONLY ME an answer to a question, but then being shot in the head and instantly dying after asking but before Mr. Meeseeks could even speak.  Existence is pain and the goal was the only thing keeping me going through it.

Now it's gone and I can't even accomplish it.  The only way to avoid death would be to find another purpose, but I don't know how to do that, except that it involves letting go of my last purpose.  Thing is, I CAN'T do that.  I don't know why either, I just can't.  It's like asking me fly like Superman, or cure Donald Trump's narcissism.  It can't be done, at least not by me.

So I feel like I should die since I'll have to live with this pain for the rest of my life anyway.  Losing one's *raison d'etre* is one of the worst things anyone could experience, if not THE worst.  Your reason for being is even more important than the air your breathe because without it, what use is the air?

Once again, I'm at that point where I just want to die.  The pain is just too much.  I wish I had a gun, or something else that would make it quick and relatively painless.  If I have to live the rest of my life with this pain, then the very least I deserve is a death swift enough to be considered painless.",S
3,"Hi. I’m new here but literally had no one to talk to. Idk what to do. I’ve been taught if I was kind and did good and helped others. Life would be great. But I feel like everyone for some reason starts abusing me. Getting mad at me. And leaving me. I’ve tried so hard. I’ve tried to change and be less emotional and caring. But I can’t. It’s just who I am. I can’t stop caring and loving so much. Everyone has turned their back on me. Even tho my family try to come back into my life. I just can’t find happiness with them anymore. The last person I love and care about. Has started to be mean. Idk what happened. He was such a good man. But just lol everyone else. I think he’s gonna leave soon too. He doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I’ve survived assault. Abuse. Rape. I’ve been cheated. Used. I went through losing my home and family. I’ve even lost years worth of studying and hard work. I lost my memory because someone decided to drug me. And I don’t have insurance so I’m lost in medical bills. And I always told myself I’m strong. I just feel like Im young. I’m only 21. And I feel like I’ve been through hell. Way too much I could possibly handle right now. I don’t have any real friends. I don’t have anyone to talk about my feelings with. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been through so much. I started having suicidal thoughts. These things finally started bringing me down and tearing me apart. I don’t want to live without my love. I don’t want to live alone anymore. Even when I get attention from other people. It just doesn’t make me happy. I don’t want it from them. Idk. I’m starting to think it’ll never get better. I don’t know why I’m being tortured so much when I’ve done nothing but spread light, positivity and kindness. I just want real friends. I want the world to stop taking everything away from me. Even when I had nothing. Atleast I had that person and now. Idk. It’s like all my happiness is being taken away from me and I have no control over it. I cry every day. My heart literally hurts. So much I can’t eat much. And I constantly feel like throwing up. I just want it to stop. But it never stops. When I start to be happy and take control of my life, something worse happens. What should I do?",S
4,"I've had depression since my pre-teen years. I've been through therapy. I've done everything I was ""supposed"" to do. 

Right now, I'm depressed. I'm in a bad state and I'm getting more and more worried as old feelings of being inconsolable are finding their way back in. 

Everyone says ""oh, it's okay to ask for help"" but that only works when people in your life care about you and help you when you reach out.

I've gone to my intake exam, I've been recommended further treatment and was told to wait for a call back about speaking with both a therapist and a psychologist again. Due to covid-19 nobody has called me back. 

I've reached out to family in Multiple ways and it feels like every time I reach out my hand it gets slapped away. The same sister who was such an advocate for mental health is ignoring my cries for help. My mother is too busy arguing with my father (I'm 22, I live at home because I was laid off last year and have been struggling to find work around all my panic attacks and bouts of depression that last for weeks). My fiance loves me, but he also lives in England and I'm not even sure how to approach this topic with all the other shit going on in the world. 

I guess I'm not suicidal? I'm not at risk of killing myself but I just need help. I just need a shoulder or an ear or someone. I don't get why I feel this way, there are such bigger issues in the world. 

But here I am, comparing myself to sisters I've admired my entire life and they won't even talk to me lmao. They're happy. They get to be happy, and in love, and mothers. The chance of me getting pregnant is incredibly low, so it breaks my heart to see my nephews and niece all over Facebook. It breaks my heart that our extended family wants to interact with my sisters but when i reach out to the same extended family they ignore me. My sisters are supposed to be my number 1, they're supposed to be on my team like I've been on theirs every time they've needed me and asked for me. 

I can't leave the house, I've been agoraphobic for the last few years. It's so much worse now, but at least I can hide it during this crisis. When people can go outside again I'm worried on how I'll handle it.

Anyway, I'm sorry for this. I don't know if this is the right place or not, I just had to get it out. Delete it if it's not.",S
5,"The social isolation was getting to me. I had surgery 2 months ago, I was supposed to be getting back to my normal life by now but this stupid virus prevented that. My social life basically hasn't changed since I have been isolated. To quote another redditor ""you call it quarantine, I call it Tuesday"". That realisation almost destroyed me, and probably still will. I ultimately decided to give antidepressants another go (for anxiety). I'm not sure if it will help.",S
6,I am nervous tonight. I'm crying I've always denied my suicidal thoughts as being just thoughts but tonight I really feel I might. I need someone to talk to,S
7,"These pills just make me into something I'm not. I'm ready to end everything at this point I don't care. I'm not going to live past 29 so i have a max of 10 years left. If i had a gun I'd be gone by now, and if i had blades I'd be relapsing. Ill never truely be happy or really know what its like to be sane. I just want to be put to sleep once and for all, to just feel deaths cold touch consume me and be done with this all. I never asked to be born so why can't I choose when I want to leave.",S
8,"I used to actively fantasize about suicide just so I didnt have to think. I've come a long way and even though I feel like I should be better, I am still not. But now I look at suicide as an opportunity. I choose to believe we are reincarnated. There cant just be nothing right? I wish that I will be similar to how I am now, but with more passion and less of a tragic everything. Maybe have a better mom. I like the things I do, but for some reason can't enjoy anything or have any ambition for anything. I live in the moment unprepared for the future, but every moment I live in is hell. So tonight I was thinking about how I want to be if I am reincarnated. I know it is probably not true. But I havent felt this excited in a long time. I want to die and be a new better person. I'm really not well adapted to life. I've been doing everything in my power to get better but unfortunately, any small insignificant thing is enough to set me back at the beginning.",S
9,"It's been two months and I've already found what I thought I'd never find: happiness.
If you were asking for a sign, stop waiting, this is it. 
You can and you will get better. It can take time, but you will get better eventually. So please, don't be afraid to seek help, there are great moments in life waiting to happen; don't take them away from yourself and your loved ones. Don't listen to your demons, fight them, do whatever you have to do.
Stay safe!",S

11,"I’m in pain every single day, throughout the day do to a gastrointestinal disorder that I have. It’s slowly taking everything I enjoy away from me. I can’t eat any of my favorite foods or most food without experiencing excruciating pain during or almost immediately after. My body no longer processes alcohol at all, I can’t go out with my friends, I can’t work on a regular basis, I can’t plan ahead for literally anything. I’m just so tired of it all. I’m tired of constantly having to give things up and adapt because that’s what’s expected from me. Adjusting my diet, adjusting my career, adjusting literally everything that brings me joy for something that will probably always bring me pain. 

I’m on my early twenties and I dread the thought of living a long life. I think about dying ever day; especially when I’m isolated in the bathroom experiencing the worst pain of my life with no exit; No medical remedy and nothing to alleviate this constant up and down pain. I just sit in the bathroom by myself begging for death and crying my eyes out because I know my wish won’t be granted anytime soon. My health is getting progressively worse and I don’t know what to do or how to cope anymore. I feel like I’m decaying physically and mentally from the inside out. 

I’m scared. I’m exhausted. I’m in pain.",S
12,"I've just made this account today as a means to vent, and I have never been on this sub before, so I'm not sure how to go about this. 

A little background information to give more context on my situation and mental health: I began engaging in suicidal behavior at a very young age, but didn't manage to wind myself up in the hospital until I was 15. I was diagnosed with PTSD and major depression at 16. When under abnormal amounts of stress I sometimes have auditory hallucinations and delusions (the most recent instance was yesterday night which consequently triggered this post). I don't want to get into the specifics of the traumatic events I've experienced, but I will say that I have experienced psychological, physical, sexual, verbal, and emotional abuse. I have self harmed on and off from about 9 years old. 

I know no one on this sub is a doctor or anything, I just want it to be understood what all is at play in my head here. 

My present dilemma is this: I have almost no one. My father ignores me although I reach out regularly, I don't have a close relationship with my mother as she was very abusive towards me and my older sister growing up, and as for my sister, we communicate here and there but our relationship is beginning to feel more and more disconnected. So as far as my family goes, I don't have anyone I feel like I can truly open up to. I do have my boyfriend and a roommate who I do feel I can open up to, but at the end of the day, theres some issues they just aren't equipped to help me with. I'm also not able to start seeing a therapist as I just lost my job and insurance. 
I don't know how to word this next part other than that I really feel like I deserve to die. I've made so many mistakes in my life and am so undeserving of the little good that I do have. I feel like I serve no purpose other than to be miserable and make others miserable by being a massive burden. 
I'm also simply wearing thin. I can't sleep at night either because of nightmares or I become paranoid for some strange reason and start hearing a voice in my head. Last night I started to believe that someone was going to shoot me in my sleep for some reason and thus stayed up all night staring at my bedroom door and the voice was saying things like ""we need to get out of here.""   ""they want to hurt us."" And ""we can't do this. "" I felt like I could barely breathe and I tried to calm myself down by acknowledging that no one was going to hurt me, and that I was the only one there, there was no ""we"" but unfortunately it didn't help and I was stuck feeling afraid for my life over something that I was well aware was a delusion. 

I am so tired, I feel so useless and weak, but I am still reaching out because I want to be here for the people that do care. I know it wouldn't be fair to them if I killed myself, but I'm also being realistic with myself about how close I am to the edge and understanding that willpower alone wont keep me from going over. 

Sorry if I rambled on or made little sense, I just need to get it off my chest.",S
13,Just need some to pull down from the ledge,S

15,"My parents are abusive, just horrific people. I felt like growing up and now I have zero support and like the people around me are accepting of abuse. Have you ever been beaten told your friend and they said ""so my parents beat me get over it you pussy?"" who the fuck says that. I feel like everyone around me is insane.",S
16,"I've wanted to kill myself for months.  I've had guns to my head and pussied out.  Why cant I just end my suffering already?  Every day its gonna be the same shit.  

I just really want to get the courage.  It would probably help to get blackout drunk then pull the trigger but I want to be self aware, you know?  I have a good life compared to other people.  That's why my wife and most people dont understand why I'm like this.  I just want to be alone.  Dead and not meaningful to anybody",S
17,"I know I have privileged life, I should be grateful of whatever I have or accomplished, I only wanted two things in my life, one was having a home of my own, and another to have a partner to share it with. I thought those were simple, and doable requests. and never made myself other goals or wishes, I thought that, once I had them I could, sit and enjoy the rest of my life. but I always fail at my relationships, I always make so much mistakes, I end up alone, I pushed away friends and family, I have no other meaningful or fulfilling relationships. I know my family loves me, I know they might suffer. But I don't care much about that at this point. I feel so alone, and abandoned. I don't have the balls to kill myself. But life seems so worthless, I don''t have the energy, the motivation, the will, to do anything anymore, I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everyday is just as numbing as the previous one. I don't want to make more efforts, more sacrifices, I have given up on life. and yet I don't have the balls to end it. I am afraid I don't succeed. I don't sleep, or eat. I stoped enjoying everything. I think I have a way to hang myself, maybe I seek just that little push to finally do it.",S
18,"Especially during this quarantine.  Work slowed way down and I was put on standby and am currently waiting on unemployment to come through.  I sleep a lot and the days have blended together.  It's only been a little over a week but it feels like it's been a month.  

When I did have a job, it was low paying, and I was stuck there.  I couldn't, for the life of me, find another or better job.  I'm stuck because I need the healthcare attached to this job.  I'm stuck because I'm a terrible resume builder, I'm a terrible interviewer, and I can't even get a response 99% of the time with my applications. 

I'm sick.  I'm poor.  I'm sad.  I'm fat.  And I can't change any of those aspects. 
I'm a T1 diabetic that will need insulin for the rest of my life.  There is no cure, there is no changing that.  It dominates my life and everything I do I have to plan around it.  
I'm poor.  I make barely over minimum wage, I can't afford to travel.  I can't afford to have nice things or hobbies that I enjoy.  I don't know how to change my financial situation, I'm stuck.  
I'm sad as fuck.  I'm terrible with people, the only girl that gives a fuck about me on this entire planet lives 2000 miles away.  She has an established career and cannot move here.  I'm too poor and suck at finding a job and with my health issues I cannot move to her.  I miss her a lot, but I don't know if I can just sit here waiting for something to happen.  Here where I am currently, even if I were to try, I'm terrible with women and can hardly get a snapchat or a phone number.  Where as my co-workers all seem to get laid and date whoever they want with very little effort.  
I'm pretty fat.  I have no will power to restrict what I eat.  No will power to go to the gym or run.  I'm exhausted when I come home from work and have no time or energy to better myself.  At the end of a tiring day all I want is some comfort food to feel a tiny bit better about my life and that's it.  My weight has been increasing ever since about 2017 or so and plateaued around 2019.  But I'm just all jiggle and rolls and not a shred of muscle.  I don't like what I see in the mirror but I don't have the will power to go to the gym day after day for weeks before I see the smallest shred of improvement.    

I can't even drown my sorrows in alcohol.  I have the Asian flush pretty bad and before I've downed 2 drinks I'm red faced and ready to throw up.  The one thing in life that perhaps could have helped me socially, is off limits to me.  The one thing that perhaps could have gotten me loosened up and more comfortable in social situations is gone.  My life is like a fucked up joke.  

I'm introverted as fuck.  Quiet, easily forgettable.  If I don't reach out to anyone, no one will reach out to me.  As a result, life is pretty lonely.  I'm tired as fuck of life already.  I see people who have things so much better than me.  I wish I could have been more outgoing and extroverted, and craved the company of people.  Those kinds of people seem to be much more valued by society and seem to get by some how in the end.  I knew a guy that worked at a dutch bros and he was super friendly and outgoing and worked his way up the ladder and now has his own place, nice things, and cars, and seems to enjoy waking up every day for work.  

Life sucks.  The future holds nothing but death and sadness of pets and family members.  There's really nothing to look forward to.  My life seems to have peaked long ago and even then, that peak was pretty fucking small.  I'm so tired.",S
19,"I feel to kill myself because I am genuinely scared of what the world is coming to and have no hope for the future.

I understand that there is a lot more life to be lived, success can come, money can be made, or I could find the love of my life. HOWEVER, I seriously am scared of living in a cashless world ran by data and facial recognition where random people or corporations can know everything about you if they want to. I don’t even wanna live like a fucking new slave. Yes I’m a bit of a conspiracy theorist but I’ve never felt suicidal because of these things until recently",S
20,"its not as if i can go back in time and fix my mistakes, i know that already. ive made so many i can’t believe it. i know my intentions were not always good but i saw my wrongdoings too late. i realized what was good for me after i threw it away. i struggled to stay after in a world where i thought i was happy, but i had just relapsed into the same problems i got rid of. everyday i found more reasons to hate myself for everything i did to her. writing, sketching, crying and hurting myself intentionally, nothing seemed to help me cope at all. i spent so much time being sorry for what i did.

i knew i couldn’t fix anything, and i shouldn’t have tried anymore. ive got called a liar, a sociopath, fake, and more i probably cant remember. i aimed to become better than that, rather than just accept it. making new friends, having new interests. it got my mind off of things. but it’s always there in my head, i cant go to sleep at night sometimes even, im paranoid whenever im forced to be around her. i know my presence hurts her more than it hurts mine. and my few close friends i had that left me because of everything i did, i accepted it. i knew the consequences, im not gonna try to run from them. never wanted to. this shit is fucking me over. its impossible to keep taking steps to be a better person. i tell myself im not a burden but i am",S
21,"There's nothing for me in life. 

I'm 17, about to go to college, but I know I won't be able to function. I screwed up my FAFSA and applied too late, and got nearly nothing in aid. I got a scholarship, but that barely dented the cost of attendance. I keep fucking everything up- I can't be trusted to take care of myself. Plus, I'm a trans guy with an unsupportive mother, so that adds a whole new set of shit I'll have to deal with, all by myself. 

For the past few years, I hoped I'd be able to actually have a friend group in college- actually be able to live as myself and have people that actually care about me and find me enjoyable to be around, but I realized that was ridiculous. Dysphoria has eroded at my self-esteem so much that I haven't really had any friends for nearly the entirety of high school. I look like shit and I know I look like shit, so why would anyone want to be around me? I clam up and stumble over my words around everyone, so I sound stupid. I'm just not meant to be around people- I feel so alienated from other people it's almost like I'm a different freaking species. This is no way to live. There's a lake a short walk from where I live- I'm going to take something heavy then sink myself to the bottom. It's better than always being the odd one out.",S

I don’t even know how I didn’t take my life studying medicine. There are good moments but from time to time I end up completely devastated. I never tried professional help because I don’t believe in them. My life is perfect, I love my family, my friends, my dog. I just can’t continue lying to everyone. I’m not okay.

23,I think the title speaks for itself. I brighten other people’s days but not my own. I spread joy to others but can’t feel any joy myself. I make other people laugh but all I feel is dread.

How did those words make you feel??""

25,"I thought I better say something to someone somewhere. I've been spending time looking at suicide prevention hotlines lately but always decide against calling. 

I've been depressed for over 10 years now, I never talk about it, no therapy or anything. I just try to keep my hands busy. It helps for a while. Now that things are slowing down for everyone and we're isolating I can't sleep, I don't eat. I think about the set of circumstances I'm dealing with now and how the affects of it ripple over to everything. I'm nowhere near the end of it and already it cost me everything. The ripples will be a tsunami by the end. 

I love my kids more than anything in the world. Spending time with them, watching them grow and wondering what they will become. Watching their eyes swell everytime I leave, hearing them cry inside as I walk to the car. It fucking rips me apart. I want to be there for them more than anything, but I can see how painful it is to them. They feel betrayed and confused. Me too kiddos.

In 10 years I went from homeless to well off and back to homeless, depressed the entire time with a couple shining moments in between. Everything I worked towards, and became. Gone. My kids get roped in with me too. All because I told myself to stick it out, things will get better. 

I'm hurting. They're hurting. I could do more for them as a check. It's better than what I got. 

I've never been good at talking about how I felt. I never wanted to worry the people who kept me going. I zigged when I should have zagged. 

Maybe I'm wrong. I've been wrong before, but I've been right too.

47,"With the lockdown and curfew going in my country due to the current pandemic, I find myself in some sort of twisted dilemma. For around seven years, I have become more and more socially awkward, which was worsened by the bullying I suffered through elementary, two years ago I tried to kill myself and ended up in the hospital for a couple of months. Over the past year, I was fine, enjoying my classmates as we were the only class in the school, as it was about to shut down. When this year kicked in, I entered school and ever since my anxiety just got worse, as I shake and sweat without any real reason at any time of the day. For example as I write this post I am shaking so badly I have to erase a word twice to get it right along with excessive sweat. In my new school, I encountered something rather curious, that some personality traits of my new classmates are the same to those of my first school, where I was bullied, something that has made me uneasy. Along with this, the fact that the last school I attended was all male, I can not interact with my female classmates, something that has left me in awkward and depressing scenerios.

The dilemma I found myself submerged in is that I do like the lockdown and the curfew, as I am in my house doing all I want without facing some aspects of my poor social life but, this isolation has left me with the only thing you'll always have, your own thoughts. My own psyche, which is off the rails now, has been forcing me to do too much introspection about my life, a filthy sack of lies that has been on fire for years. My loneliness has been pushing me to an edge, I can't sleep properly at night, being awake at 5AM just remembering and realizing how much I crave for something I will never find. Even though I have not even reached my twenties I feel as if I have wasted all of my years so far, with no friends, no significant other, just a conflicted, awkward, ugly and inacceptable mess.

All these sleepless nights have shown me how insignificant I am, the idea of death has scared me more than it used to do, as my loneliness says it right: if I die, there will never be someone to see it. Some people say the best in life comes later, that with the time I will learn and grow through trial an error, but I am simply tired, I am not patient enough to wait for more years to come, I have been hurt in such a way that the thought of carrying on causes disgust in me. I wrap myself in so many blankets to feel at least some warm as I just stare into my nightstand, hearing all those memories that haunt me. I am trapped in my past and can't get out. I never accomplish anything I propose to do, I am just a waste of space and should just be laying 6 feet deep.",S

And that’s the worst part, is that this shit sucks, but it’s arguably better than her not being in my life anymore. I love her, and she doesn’t love me back. She doesn’t know I still have a crush on her, and when I hear her talk about other guys I want to die. And when I realize that the reason me and her aren’t going to be a thing is completely my fault, I want to die. I have no way of getting past a lot of the problems in my life, and the crush on her is one of the big ones. Not being able to say that one thing is going to be the death of me",S
50,"I don't have anyone in my life that cares anymore. A few people have reached out, but it doesn't work because it's not physically there. My therapist described it as hopping on one leg, and sometimes I need something or someone to lean on. But right now, it's an empty room with no walls, nothing to lean on.

People always ask me about my friends and family. My mom (who has always been the closest to me) I haven't seen in over a month and a half, AND she lives 3 hours away. My dad is a selfish prick who stays up until 1 am playing fortnite and doesn't help me with any normal teenager stuff. (He expects a 16M to be able to afford a car, gas, insurance, while working a part time job). My stepmom over reacts every time, to the point where it doesn't help me, it just makes things worse (at least she's giving an effort to help, even if it doesn't do much). And my brother doesn't fucking care much less listen.

I don't have any friends right now. I have abandonment issues, because of some really traumatic shit that happened in my past, and my mom had to leave and never told me when she'd be back. But when my 'friends' text me and just fucking disappear it really destroys me inside. The longest conversation I've had in the past month is 6 minutes. I cant go see anyone face to face not because no one wants to talk to me but because I'm in fucking quarantine. I'm kind of drifting away now that I think about it.

Back to my parents. They don't know what the fuck they are doing. They got pissed because I wanted two Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches instead of one. The other day they had me eat almonds for breakfast. Something has to change because it fucking tears me down whenever they yell at me for whatever the fuck I did wrong.

I've come to this sub way too many times. I can't just rely on random strangers to get me through my problems. I have to be able to get through shit on my own. I'm fucking worthless. 

My dad has to run up to Home Depot tomorrow so he can start painting the house. My brother will want to go with, so maybe I can stay at home and try to bust open the safe or something. ""I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain"" - XXXTentacion (Jocelyn Flores)

55,"I'm not sure if I'm depressed, I've just lost interest in living. I figured since I've been planning on my own death at age 30 since I was 16(21 now) I know it's going to be over soon. 

I'm not here to blame anybody, but I'm going to share my story. When I was young my dad worked constantly and I never really saw him much because when I woke up for school he was at work and then I'd be in bed when he came home. My mom was a stay at home mom and I got really close to her with my siblings. Anyways, when I was maybe 5-6 I developed night terrors and couldn't sleep, I got really into video games and that's all I really wanted to do. I became addicted and played non stop, I went days not sleeping and stayed up all night playing until my brain hurt. I started having troubles in school and was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7-8. My memory started to go into decline and I'm positive it was from my excessive habit of staring at a TV screen so close + my lack of sleep. Well by age 10 my parents became concerned because my memory had literally been wrecked. So they threw me on meds and I became a walking zombie and developed suicidal thoughts at that age or so. Well, 3 years later a month after turning 13, I opened the front door of our house to paramedics and they rushed my mom out on a stretcher with a oxygen mask on her face. She died 15 hours later and I was crushed. I trusted my mom more than anyone in the world and she was my best friend because I had troubles making friends. 

Anyways fast forward a little bit, at age 14 I decided to start using drugs and alcohol and that's all I wanted to do because I hated myself. I was a insecure fuck and knew damn well I had issues. Again I went days not sleeping getting drunk smoking weed and this kept up until on and off for awhile. I developed suicidal thoughts around the age of 16, and everytime I thought about if I got in the habit of telling myself to wait until I was 30. I stopped trying in school and was a nervous wreck, totally insecure because of my short term memory loss so I didnt conversate unless I liked the person or had to. I still had a good amount of friends, but I didnt branch out. The quality of friends weren't so great, out only interested were drugs and alcohol and this lead to me wanting to kill myself so many times but I didnt change. Fast forward to senior year i stopped all that stuff and had been sober a year. I wanted to join the military but knew my short term memory would absolutely disqualify me and I bet they would have kicked me out of boot/basic if I had even made it.

I've really put myself down lately because I've dropped out of college 3 times now. I've taken meds but they really dont help, I've learned to hate myself more and more over the years and still live at home with my dad and stepmom. I've lost a lot of drive because I want to die. I've been hoping for a societal collapse so I wouldn't have to kill myself later but I guess we will see what happens. Sorry for the rambling, I just hate myself and I know things can always be worse. But I dont see a point to living my life, I'm worthless honestly. I've felt happy for the most part, at least I think. Suicide doesn't even bother me and I've thought about it so much over the past few years that it's normal to me. I'm like 80% sure I going to do it one day. I just dont know how much I want to put into life before I do.",S
56,,
57,"I can't stop thinking about it.

Ever since things really started to speed up with the pandemic, I've been thinking about killing myself more and more.  I've had suicidal ideation for the past 20 years, so it's not an unfamiliar feeling but I feel like lately I've been on an elevator of hopelessness that's getting close to the top.  

I have...not exactly my dream job, but a job in a field I love, doing things that excite me; it's a job that has helped me stave off depressive thoughts in the past.

I work in film exhibition and the festival I was running was cancelled mid way through like so many others.  So much work down the drain. Looking at refund requests for days on end, from all across the spectrum- some angry at us for cancelling or being slow (it's just two people processing hundreds of individual refunds), some desperate to get money back because they've lost income, some clearly totally oblivious to the peril that all the lost revenue puts the institution in (""what a bummer, well, see you next year! I'd like my refund immediately please.""). Now as it is more and more apparent that the quarantine will last a very long time, I am fairly certain that I will be laid off very soon but what's more, I'm worried the institution I work for won't survive it either. 

I don't really want to do a different job in this town. And the entire field of film exhibition has been decimated, so its not likely that I'll ever get to do this kind of a job again in my lifetime.  

My supervisor just asked me to describe all the kinds of critical work I do.  So the lay off is on the horizon and quickly approaching.  

Beyond being a job that's given me something to keep from feeling so shitty about life, I'd just started to do new tasks there that really excited me, I love my team of co-workers and new exciting things were very much just over the horizon.  

But now I feel like such an idiot for even going into this field.  My parents always wanted me to go into engineering, and I could have, but no, for some reason (read: my profound stupidity and idiotic ambitions) I chose to study film like some stereotype of bad personal decisions. Now everything will be out of reach. I'll have to go to a programming bootcamp like literally every other stupid failed film school student and spend the rest of my life in a job I hate feeling sad that I can't do what I always wanted to, and regretting not getting any further.

I just feel useless and, like I'm sure many others around here, anxious as hell about the very real likelihood that the impending economic depression is going to seriously fuck me for ever trying to do something I like for a living.  

So, all that habitual suicidal ideation I've grown so accustomed to is really starting to feel like the last remaining option.  I just reread a document I found the last time I got serious with instructions on my chosen method. Takes ordering some item, so it'll be at least a few days, but heck, as I was thinking the other day, at least I probably wouldn't have to worry about anyone trying to revive me if they found me- it's a pretty easy triage choice to let the suicide die in the middle of a pandemic.

77,"I live in a household with an individual (unfortunately, a sibling) who is psychologically abusive. I suffer from childhood trauma up until now. Due to social isolation and the fact that Steven has not moved out yet (31M), I am frequented with daily anxiety, depressions, and suicidal thoughts. Let me outline this for you:

\- I struggle to experience happiness. Every time I felt joy about something and he was within vicinity. he would pull this face and mumble under his breath, effectively changing my mood. I am humble, however I realise that it is at the point where I feel undeserving of any good that happens to me.

\- I am unable to be social. When I had firends over or friends insisted on coming over, I would freeze. Historically, he does not say hello, and ALL my friends who had come over had thought of him as unwelcoming and rude. I have friends that understand that I have a poorly raised sibling, and I am thankful that they do not let that determine whether they want to be friends with me.

\- He uses my parents. They provide food and a roof over his head, yet he cusses them out and refuses to listen to them. My mother drives him to the train station for him to go to work because he does not have his own car, but he takes his time getting ready. My mother gets annoyed and he cusses her out when she says to hurry up. She is a healthcare worker and has a job to go to herself, yet the kindness in her heart offers to be a chaffeur to him.

\- He DOES NOT ADHERE TO STRICT HYGIENE STANDARDS. My father is diabetic and is at high risk with COVID-19. Steven still goes out (to buy non-essentials, and possibly pays to get fucked because God forbid he has anyone to want him HAHA). He does not wash his hands voluntarily, and needs to be screamed at, to which he cusses you out. He pisses on the toilet seat, let alone even lifts it up (hey, I'm abl to put a seat up and down myself, but how can a grown adult not lift a seat himself?). He does not help with chores. He is useless in this household. Steven is a nuisance and needs to stay away from my family, or better yet kill himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of his psychological abuse I have had daily anxiety and depression. I have had suicidal thoughts for the past year and lash out in angry screaming bursts when I hear him cussing out my family. I go to therapy BECAUSE OF HIM. He is the sole reason why I am the way I am. I have social anxiety. I hate myself. I admit that for years now I have daydreamed of pushing HIM to be suicidal; I want him to feel and know that he is useless, unloved, and unwanted. I daydream of him accidentally falling down the stairs, me seeing him at the bottom, and just calmly going back to my room, pretending that I didn't know anything happened, only to let my parents find him hours later. I daydream of him having an outburst and smashing his head against corners and ledges, because that is exactly what his abuse has made me do for just over a year now. I want him dead.

I honestly don't know what is the point of this post. I don't know what advice or medication is going to do, because I have to live with the cause of my trauma until God knows how long.

On a positive note, I am surrounded otherwise with wonderful people who I am grateful for. Unfortunately, I feel that I am unable to fully experience this due to the presence of Steven Yuan.",S

I've tried for so many years to beat this and to get better and to make myself better... and it just never works.  I always feel like the odd one out. And I'm just so exhausted.  I'm just so tired. 

TBH, I'm not going to kill myself, but I'm at the stage where I feel like suicide is just going to be present in my life. Like the raven looking down at my life.  Sometimes, it's going to be on my shoulder and sometimes, it's gonna be a few feet away.  I'm probs going to get up tomorrow and try again and keep trying. Keep going to therapy. Keep up with the positive self talk and the self compassion. But deep down, part of me is like, why bother? What if I'm meant to be like this? What if I'm going to kill myself at some point?  IDK....",S

I deal with so much fucking shit then they make me angry. I lashed out and i haven't done that in years. I'm losing my sanity.  

I have 0 friends in real life. Mind as well say I have no family either... I'm trapped in a house with 5 people. Abusive and toxic family that has hated me ever since I was born. It's literal hell for me and I have no escape since everything is shut down from the virus. I can't take it any longer. Suicide feels like the only option.",S

I feel like if I speak out, it'll just seem like a phase to my parents. 

I decides to speak out about this stuff to some online friends, and they said I could push through it. I really don't know if I can. Everyone thinks I'm gonna make it in life. I gonna repeat 8th grade, not get to go to the high school I want to go to and end up pondering my decisions for the rest of my life, how ever long that my be now.

98,"I wrote a post [On March 19, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fl8n2m/overdosing_soon/) telling anyone who'd listen that I was going to overdose. And I did. 

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP. 

Life might always say No to what I want, and Death said no to my needs.. but fuck you - I'm not saying no to getting help!

*I can't*",S
99,No one cares. Literally no one. The last person I thought might care about me that I could take comfort in clearly doesn't anymore. I'm unlovable and worthless. That's all I'll ever be. I just want to waste away into nothing. I hate every day so fucking much.,S

101,"As the title says, I've been struggling with depression and I have quite literally negative self-esteem.

It doesn't help that my ex broke up with me a while ago because ""She couldn't settle for me"".

But this isn't about me being broken up with.

My life is pretty rough, I'd say.

I've been depressed for a long time now. 7 years, to be exact. Going on 8 in a few months. 

I used to not be able to sleep properly which caused me to turn to the bottle for a few hours of rest.

I started drinking about 2 years into my depression.

I've stopped it, however. Same with the self-harm that I forgot to mention. 

But I honestly want to go back to it right now.

I'm pretty young. Just 16 and I've seen quite a few things.

I pulled my other uncle out of a drug addiction once, even. But I have a feeling he's back to it now.

I feel like a burden to my family whom I deeply love and care for. However, I feel as if they don't like me. Their treatment of me is a bit uncaring. Though, they claim that it isn't.

I would often be compared to my little sister, who is 3 years my junior.

I've never even met her.

I'm often put down by my family. Unappreciated by those who I want to care for. 

They would berate me for things that I didn't know I even had to do. They would scold me and tell me to do something like try harder in school.

Even though I'm already trying my best.

I try to tell them that I am trying my best, but all they would say is ""You should be"". 

I never got the sense of pride from them. It was always directed at others.

They would often tell me that their life back when they were my age was so much harder. Not knowing how it affects me.

I'm never listened to.

So I stopped speaking. I stopped talking about my problems and just wallowed in my own personal hell.

It doesn't help that I'm talentless either. Neither am I good looking or fit.

Honestly, I can't even talk to people properly. I'm too awkward.

And people tend to not approach me either because of my general disposition.

My mother. She's in Australia, currently and I'm in the Philippines.

We rarely talk.

She talks to my brother all the time, however.

And I only really get a few words given to me. Never asked about my day or anything.

I try to understand, really. She has her own kid. And I heard she's even pregnant right now. My half-siblings.

But deep down, I wished she would talk to me.

Earlier, I mentioned my grandmother.

She pays for my tuition. Not my parents.

She runs herself ragged in America, working. She rarely gets time off and is almost never in her home in there.

She's a strong woman. 

I wish I got some of that strength too.

She went through hell too. But she still came out on top.

But she isn't without her flaws either.

She often calls me spoiled or compares me to my cousins who are honestly more spoiled than I am. They don't even respect their parents whom I have a great deal of respect for despite everything.

I don't even know what my father is doing either. He doesn't even have a job, much like my mother.

To think that the two of them got into drugs too, at some point. My mother even did them while I was in the same room.

I often get blamed for their problems.

My father once told me that I was the reason his relaitonship with my grandmother fell apart.

He even told me that he'd kill me like a dog. Even though I was doing as he told me.

I wished he did, honestly.

If he did, I wouldn't be going through this right now.

If it wasn't obvious by now, my father is verbally and emotionally abusive.

The two of them honestly only seem proud of me whenever there are visitors around. 

It's almost pathetic. They have to have their failure of a son to brag about being so smart and shit but when the doors close, I'm just another tool to them. I'm back to being berated.

I'm like a tool to them.

And I can't do anything to stop them.

The only reason they got me a psychiatrist was because my school counsellor recommended it.

And even then, my father fucked it up and got me dropped by my psychiatrist.

It happened because he complained about how long it took for our turn and he got mad at her and said he'd just find a different psychiatrist.

Guess what, he didn't.

And the first thing he said to me when I asked him what happened is ""She said you were okay now."" Which was a lie that he admitted to moments later.

But despite admitting that, he just doesn't see that he was doing anything wrong. Even defending himself, saying that it was okay and that he was the one in the right because my psychiatrist's secretary was acting unprofessionally.

Which she wasn't.

Now I'm living off of a months old prescription with no psychologist, psychiatrist, or counsellor to talk to.

Seriously, I can't make this up.

But yeah, I kinda just feel like shit and have nothing to look forward to in life. 

I sit alone in my room and play video games in my free time in an attempt to distract myself from the mad house that is my home.

It's honestly exhausting and I'm tired of being seen as nothing but a tool or a means to an end.

I know it may not be as bad as the other posts here but it's driving me to the point of wanting to commit suicide. Again.

Speaking of which, if I did commit suicide, they'd likely just be even more ashamed of me than they already are.

My father sees me as a coward for trying. He said so himself.

TL;DR: I'm a depressed and suicidal teen who still cares about the people who made him that way.",S

Hanging seems like a good clean way, but it's kinda dramatic as a means to go out and then be talked of as the guy who hung himself. Whereas a gunshot to the head would likely be traumatic to the person finding the body not to mention the mesa and potential for a crime scene investigation until suicide is confirmed

Does an overdose in a hotel seem alright? It seems peaceful enough, although that could also be kinda traumatizing to a housekeeper. But maybe they've all seen that stuff before?

Yesterday the straw that broke the camels back was that I decided to leave my family’s group chat. This was due to the passive aggressive behaviour of other members, which has been an ongoing pattern over many years. 

I feel as though I have two options: 1 enter a life of seclusion where I live on my own and don’t have anything more to do with family. Or 2 accept that the best years are behind me and tie up all my loose ends arranging a swift exit.

Option 2 could benefit many people as I have savings I could give to friends who have not been as fortunate as me financially. I can think of a few in particular who would be extremely grateful for what I could do for them.

Option 1 would involve reorganising my life though at this point I am very tired of reorganising my life and starting again - tried this multiple times and everything always flops.

I have a few days off work so I will be able to ponder over this for a while and make arrangements should I decide on Option 2.

126,So I don’t understand why but I’m giving up on life. My mind is constantly filled with things that shouldn’t be there. I just went to the beach and didn’t even have one good memory. Literally I’ve just given up on everything. My supposedly job i start Tuesday isn’t even worth the trouble. I’ll stay there maybe a month at most and leave like always. I use heroin everyday to cope with issues I’ve had the past few years. I cut myself daily because of feeling so terrible and hated the best way to enjoy my self is self mutilation. I hate my life I really do. People act so nice and have so many different opinions about you that it makes you feel like complete shit. I hear things constantly In my head. I hate it. I never asked to be this way but it’s just more shit to add to the story. Nobody ever really cares. I’ve been in 6 psycwards for all the same reasons. I literally can’t go to the beach without having problems all because of this and that it’s never ending cycle and some day’s is pure hell. Everyone just disagrees with everything I ever say or decisions I make since I’m stuck in a a place where every wrong decison haunts you over and over again. I can’t enjoy music or even feel comfortable in my own house. I live with my parents and all I do is make my mom cry when she’s on her hands and knees cleaning up the dried puddles of blood with tears running down her face. And she just pretends everything is okay. People expect like to be so adventurous and fun and beautiful but I never see any of that shit. It’s the dark grey moments I dwell in because the life I live is not somthing I’d wish on my worse enemy. I started out in highschool and was honestly a joke and a loser. I had terrible things cross my mind because of that place. I became a drug user to cope with those problems. I became a “gangster” and learned it all from google from hand shakes to gang signs. I had enemies for being a “poser” and nearly have lost my life. I hate my self once again I really do. I have cuts from head to toe. I just feel like I’ll be set free from this if I follow through with my suicide attempt. I believe I’m gonna use heroin since it’s a peaceful way to go. I still unsure if I’m gonna do this but it’s the best way for me. I don’t have anything here but a mom and dad. Once there gone I really won’t have anything left.

I didn’t think I’d ever actually commit. Ofcourse when I’m feeling low I consider it but doesn’t everyone? But- my mom has a few attempts and even the idea of her feeling *that* low really shakes me- so I couldn’t do that to my family. But now, I’m worried one of my dark moments will be it for me.

I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, im really not sure tho im just completly lost in my life i have no idea what im doing, i dropped out of school im losing all my freinds, its my fault i understand that but i actually really dont fucking care, i want to be alone i dont want to work or go to school not because im lazy but because i want to hurt someone even kill, just random people those who havent done shit wrong, of course im never going to do it, but I JUST WANT TO SO BADLY SOMETIMES.

I hate people who complain over life, i feel like so many people are faking deppresion and it makes me so mad to the point that i want to hurt them. like life is fucking hard deal with it its the same for the rest of us aswell. Im going to psychologist, but i never tell the truth i only lie constantly, its weird how much i enjoy lying. I dont want to work its like a death sentence i rather die then work tbh. i hate people in general, i just want to be alone. Im really populare like everyone knows how i am people are very fascinated by me, when i went to school i was always late, i came late on purpose and ditched in the middle of the class. my classmates looked at me as the guy who legit didnt give a single fuck about life, i was also the class clown. but when school was over i would just lay in bed, not talking with anyone, i never send snaps i never post anything on facebook or instagram, i must be really mysterious to people. When i go to store to buy cigaretts i hear people talking about me like they whisper to eachother but them idiots i can hear you, of course i pretend to not hear them because i dont really give a fuck what they say to about me anyways. i dont know where my life is about to go and i dont care either im 18 btw. i want to die i really do, and that breaks my heart, because there WAS so much i used to love doing, like play video games play soccer, i dont do any of that anymore...

i dont wanna explain anymore, ive told my story to countless therapists over the years to the point where i dont know where i do not know where to start. 

i wanna cry out for help but i dont know to who, ive built this atmosphere where im stuck socially between people who constantly depend on me for emotional support and people who treat me like a sex object. 

i wanna sink into someones arms but i dont know whos, im everybodys friend but nobodys best friend, im a second choice to everyone. plus i dont have anyone i can hug. thats all i want, a hug and maybe some hair ruffles

i wanna rest but i cant no matter what there are people who need me. there are always things i need to do. i never feel safe anyway. i dont live with my abusive mother anymore so im not getting beat or anything.i just never feel fully safe.

165,"I tried ending it and got fairly close a little over a year ago was in a really tough place my best friend for years and years had gone off the deep end of schizophrenia. hearing voices, those voices told him to kill me making the friendship kinda die a little but tried to not let it seep into my mental health. with this, I was also in an extremely toxic relationship with my girlfriend at the time, she did everything a lover shouldn't but I didn't love her but I didn't leave either every time I did she would say she would kill herself. on top of this, I was extremely bipolar and on the wrong meds. So one night I decide I'm done the setup was just got done seeing my friend right out of the psych ward, the bad part was he shoulda still been in. so we met up my ex (girlfriend at the time) after a while he left. she wanted sex, I didn't. this was normal after a little she got bored and impatient and forced sex, still normal. In the past sex would feel almost nice, or painful, or something. this time nothing I didn't get anything at. no feeling. I finished. she left to go back home. I remember not feeling angry, tired, sad, just nothing, and that was scary. I was empty this time and I didn't know what to do. so I cut my arms in till everything was red, then my chest. after awhile everything was red but it didn't hurt, I just felt warm and fuzzy, but still just as empty. after cutting like this I would usually sleep, do something else, or shower to make it hurt worse. I didn't do any of this. I realized if nothing cause's any feeling what's the point? being sad sucks. but nothing hurts like nothing at all. so I decided I'm done. I texted one of my friends at the time. and said should I kill myself? he said sure. so to honor his advice I took four pill bottles, drank a ton of lean, snorted a ton of painkillers, and drank a case of energy drinks. I did this and kinda just sat and thought what now? so walked out of the room and laid on the couch that wayfinding my nonresponsive body wouldn't be too hard for my family. twoish days later. I wake up look around, everything uncomfortably pale, realize my body aches like nothing I've ever felt, my dick hurts, and I can't move my arms or legs, there tied down. I look around and see my arms are all filled with tubes and shit. after investigating this, I look to my left a window looking out into the city, with my dad in a pile of blankets. I ask him ""where am I?"" he says I'm in a hospital after a several day coma from an overdose. I next asked him why does my dick hurt so bad he told me there was a ballon in it this was upsetting information to hear, to say the least. the nurse came in she was one of the sweetest people I've met, she had the most beautiful way of waking up some edgy depressed teen. slowly bringing me back to being alive I told her jokes. we were there for hours my family slowly coming back in groups I remember asking them to bring me my guitar they did it hurt like hell to play my boredom got the best of me. overtime I started feeling selfish for absorbing my family's life. the more I came back the more my body hurt. I got asked by a woman. why you do it? will you try again? are you okay? I lied to everything. it worked I got sent home. anyways life was hell I got back into life everyone knew what I did and made fun of me telling me to do it again, I always joked ""yea I will just give me a min to work on it"". the summer was hell my ex kept telling me don't leave, or you gonna the minute school opens back up. I wanted to just couldn't bear the image of her being right instantly going into school girls jumped at me saying I'm cute or asking me out. every time this happened it felt like an escape just out of reach, I wasn't into them but needed out. I was just afraid. my friend who was struggling got sent back to a psych ward about this time I met new friends and joined their group. my friend came back from the ward by this time I was done dealing with him, I just stuck around to make sure he wouldn't assault random girls, a hobby of his at this point hed touch them too much, they'd get mad some would tell teachers, some would slap. overall this didn't end well usually. my life continued it was boring but better than my past. but over time my wrist got marked, I'd make myself bleed and just freakout being like how does that happen. one example I was In class and my ex was texting me about killing herself cause of me, I started itching my hand and staring into space when I came back I bit my nails and tasted metal looked at it and it was covered in blood. ripped the skin off completely still have the scar. this would happen all the time eventually being with her was hell all she wanted was sex, sex, sex. asking me to not pull out all the time. this I later realized was her trying to trap me. after this continued the only way I could bear it was by picturing a girl I was friends with was her. my new favorite position was reverse cowgirl it hurt the most but I could look at that girl's Instagram photos. shit kept going down so one day I was with my friends Alexis, Isabel, and Chase. my ex wouldn't let me hang out with girls so obviously her seeing this well I walked with them upset her. I got home with them and she kept yelling at me saying I'm coming over if you like it or not! and when I do we'll fuck! I couldn't stand it we weren't even dating, just friends with benefits cause if anything less shed hurt herself. but I snapped saying you not coming over and were never talking again. she said ima kill me I said don't, now go talk to your mom and be safe. bye. time went by I got with that girl Alexis ( the one I was friends with and would think about during sex). and life got better, but my ex continued to harass me weather death threats or threats involving calling the cops. a great combo I Should. I've been with Alexis for almost five months but my ex still effects me stressing me out with her cop threats, some days this really wears on me. I'm surrounded by good people but she still makes my life hella every few weeks. it sucks having my overdose be over a year ago but that same person who caused it in part to still hurt me, and every time she does it brings back memories of abuse, rape, depression, self-harming, and almost anything you'd not want. and cause my family doesn't know the things she did they took her side when shit went down between me and her. my own mom said I can't believe this you really disappointing me. and for all they know their right, they're supporting a lying, racist, abusive, psycho, rapist. but from her perspective shes some amazing girl whos a victim of their own son's abuse. in their eyes, I'm the bad one. and after a while, I feel like their right. everyone I know seems to look down on me somehow thinking I'm insane, pathetic, gross, rude, or just a waste of time to know. most people in my school don't know my name, I'm either crackhead, guitar guy, or something like that. very few people treat me like a human and everyone seems to like me less and less. I have very few real people in my life my girlfriend, my dad, my friends, and some family. but my dad and friends just don't know whats going on. I'm okay but every time something bad happens it just reminds me of the past and it hurts so bad. I'm so lucky to have what I have, but damn some of this shit hurts. anyways I've been getting better its just so hard sometimes looking at my arms and the faded lines telling me to do it again. I've been reaching for help more and more sometimes it feels like a bottomless pit I'm either falling or climbing both are scary to me. sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be alive, and sometimes I'm not sure if I am either way it's weird. my body has been doing this really strange thing as of late (the last month or two). where it sorta just shuts down, reminds me of my overdose to say the least this fucking sucks. it hurts physical but hits on other things that just aren't okay with me at all. sometimes I feel as if I'm shrunk this world is huge and overwhelming my problems are far less then the past, just far stranger. a lot of the time my life feels like a really calm but bad acid trip. anyways I'm better just still hurting, I'm happier just scared, I'm dating someone amazing just haunted by some abuser. life is well, and I'm slowly getting there.",S

Anxiety has prevented me from going to social events such as weddings and graduation parties. I don't even get invited usually anymore because people just know that I'm not coming.  I've recently deleted my Facebook as it was just compounding my problems. I don't know how to deal with being left on read, or someone not even opening my message but I know that they're on their phone. I couldn't handle it anymore. I often think that I only have one or two real friends and that I'm a burden to even them. I've pretty much given up on all aspects of life. I work and I sleep. Occasionally I'll play the piano and it'll help temporarily take my mind off life but it's only a short fix.

People's reasons to not kill themselves vary a lot, people talk to me about how much the people who love me would be devastated by my death, and I don't disagree with them, suicide does break families apart, but do I care? I don't think so. I'm probably a horrible person for this but I never felt any remorse for the people I'd leave behind. Because I'd be dead so minor things like trauma other people face due to my death would mean just about nothing to me. People also tell me to live for the good things in life, and I appreciate their concern regarding me but I'm not sure if snippets of joy will make live worth living for me. Sure, doing fulfilling things may make me feel better, but it's not constant so it doesnt matter. Death is constant, forever, eternal. Which makes it very desirable for me. I won't have to feel anything anymore, good nor bad. I could just exist as energy rather than an organism.

Like I don’t want to cut myself or burn myself cause that sounds really painful even long term but when I start thinking About what happened I just wanna bang my head against a wall. This happened once before when I had an awful migraine,S
203,"I don’t feel good. Frankly. I feel like it’s just a cycle. Like yea, it’ll get better, but then we’ll be here again... and who wants THAT?

My anxiety is up and all I feel is DREAD. It’s not going away. I talk about it a little bit with some friends but then I laugh it off because I’m not “the type” that’s depressed or suicidal. So I have to switch back to that “happy go lucky girl!” but Im faaaaarrrr from that rn. 

I can’t be alone - idk how to handle - I am afraid of being alone and right now it just very much feels like I am and I am trying to cope with that. 

I have switched my TV from app to app trying to put a show to distract me but not finding anything frustrated me more and I cried hard on my cat. He got scared and left. 

If I die I know people would care.. but yet when I try to talk about it, they don’t understand. I’ve tried talking to some of my best friends and like I said... it just feels like they don’t understand. Like we speak a different language or something? As if the words HI I WANT TO DIE are something they can’t process the same. 

My bf got mad at me because he says I lack common curtesy “for someone trying to make you feel better” when I told him he doesn’t get me. But he doesn’t get me lol. He isn’t here over the edge like me...guess I wish I could share screenshots of how that convo went but in no way was I being rude trying to explain my problem. 

I just feel like I’ll always be depressed no matter what I do... what I try... where I go... live... work... it’s a cycle. And I always end up here.. alone.. afraid.. in so much emotional pain that dying is the only way for it to feel like it’ll go away.",S

205,It's gotten to the point where I just want to board up my room and hang myself so that they can see I've had enough of their shit. My sisters degrade me and then act as if I'm a monster when I get sensitive about it and my parents only acknowledge me when I get bad grades. I wish I could just jump out of my window but my sisters would probably joke about how pathetic I am. I don't want to die but I just don't have the energy to live.,S

Recently I've managed to crash my car 4 times a day,/ the amount of classes i've missed thinking there weren't any.

209,"Hi guys, my brain feels like static and I’m panicking but I can’t see a light anymore. My whole family is narcissistic so I have no support system, my boyfriend is psychologically abusive, I’m stuck living back home with alcoholic mother who cries all the time and is generally psychotic at this point, ended a relationship with fiancé two years ago who cheated on me so I moved back home, dad is estranged from me and a crack addict, no friends, and the only friend I have is my boyfriends brother who I can’t talk about being emotionally abused by his brother to because it makes me sound awful and I don’t want to smear my boyfriend. I want help but I feel like I’m not allowed to ask for it. I’m 27. I’m dumb as a bag of fucking rocks and have adhd and ptsd. The only thing I’m good at is painting and I’m kind of attractive so I could probably be a cam girl or something gross down the line to make money if I end up estranged from everyone anyways what’s the point of a reputation. I just texted my employer about my condition and I know it’s not professional but like I literally don’t know what else to do. I’m on a month long waiting list for therapy. I’m too poor to move out. I’m also paranoid that if I tell anyone that I am suicidal that they will all hate me. I love my boyfriend and my parents but I just feel so psychologically unwell right now. I don’t want to smear them or anything. I love seeing my boyfriend happy but I hate it when he insults me and calls me stupid. I hate that I’m so fucking caring and loving to everyone around me that I’m just a doormat. Honestly I’m afraid I’ll never meet another man in I break up with my boyfriend because he’s determine , has a good income and he’s smart. All the other guys o ever seem to attract are addicted to weed and are lazy and I end up Having to mother them.

210,"Each day I wake up as I near closer to 24, I feel as though little has been felt to be accomplished by myself in my wandering through every new week. 

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel. 
I feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand, as I can’t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back. 

I don’t know when I will do it, but I try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year, but I sense as though I may not make it to the end of this month.",S

212,"Hi guys - I’m going anonymous for this one since I’m afraid I may be recognized.  I think I just need some support and maybe just writing this post would be enough for me - so thank you for the time.

Lately, I’ve been feeling like a burden to the people I love.  In addition to that, I feel like I can’t do anything right.  I’ve been trying to cope with a lot of negative feelings lately and I think I just need some kind of outlet before I crack.

I lost my job last month due to COVID and, even with all the government benefits, it’s still difficult to make ends meet.  I feel ashamed for being on unemployment and I feel so useless not doing any money-making activity during the day.  I’m applying to a bunch of jobs but, since my city was particularly hard hit, I’ve only been getting rejections.  The financial goals I set for myself for the year are almost certainly not going to be met and I feel like a failure because of it.

I have a girlfriend whom I love so much, but I’m beginning to feel like I’m a burden to her.  Lately, I think we’ve been having some communication issues.  I think we misunderstand each other and then just upset one another.  

Our last argument was over personal time.  I had wanted to practice French and have some alone time instead of having our usual nightly phone call.  She took offense at this and thought I wasn’t committed enough in the relationship and now she’s upset at me.  I know it’s my fault (I should have offered to chat with her for at least a few minutes and in addition to that I think I got too defensive), and I’ve apologized, but she’s still upset at me.

I already have a therapist and I’m currently taking the antidepressant Lexapro, but I still can’t help but feel like a failure.  I know to some extent that my therapist cares but at the end of the day, it’s a professional relationship.  I still pay her a fee and she listens.

Something that I’ve been thinking about is that maybe some people are better off dead than alive.  In some utilitarian calculus, it’s better to suffer a large loss (e.g. someone’s suicide) at once than to suffer low-level loss over a longer time (e.g. having someone be a live but be a burden over their entire natural life). Maybe it’s possible that I fall into that class of people.

I attempted suicide last year (December 2018) and I think one of the reasons I’m not doing it now is because I remember how sad my mom was after the attempt.  I feel like such a waste of everyone’s time and I’m kinda crying as I write this right now. 

I know I’ll be okay, but it is kinda difficult right now.  Thank you for reading.",S

214,"Where do i begin. Im 26. Male. Australian. Lived here all my life pretty normal childhood nothing that was to out of the oridanary my parents split up at a very early age so for the most part seeing one of them only on weekends was pretty normal for me up until i was about 13 when my mum moved to a different state though i cant really say its ever bothered me or affected me negatively that ive noticed.

So i lived with just my Dad up until now. Who is a great single parent and does everything he can to help me. As well as this my primary school/high school experience was good, no bullying, Had friends id catch up with reguarly. But obviously over time everybody has adult responsibilities or moves away. So not long after high school everybody stops catching up. I guess this contributes to me being a little bit lonely but for the most part i really dont mind being by myself and think its quite healthy to be able to just enjoy your own company. And its not as though i completely stop seeing friends.

My work life after highschool has be good as well regular hours, people are nice enough for the most part. I work for a tech company dealing with troubleshooting peoples computers over the phone and deploying software to them.

All in all i dont think that me wanting to kill myself has very much of a contribution to my personal life. I just really dont like anything about the society that we live in. I dont like the idea of the commute to work 5 days out of 7 of the week where everyone is aggressively driving to and from work pushing in and thinking that nobody else matters. And then after that being exhausted from a work week and not feeling as though you have the energy to do anything. Just to pay bills and be able to acyually live.

To be honest half way through writing that paragraph i was going to keep listing things i dont like but then came to the conclusion that as a whole, its just people i dont like they are rude and selfish and dont care about anyone thats a stranger to them. Obviously not all people but it feels like it just keeps getting worse as time goes on and people continue to be more disconnected from society with their phones. Kind of just wish you could go out with a mate and not have them pick up a phone for more than an hour

On top of that how much politics seem to be getting out of hand, racism, the environmental issues were facing the list could go on. Everyday its something new in the newsfeeds and usually its negative.

I guess im just having a hard time trying to understand what the point of living in a world like this is. Because i certainly wouldnt want to bring a child in to it. Cant even imagine how much worse things are going to get soon.

I feel as though ive been struggling to find a resonable answer to this as to why to go on  for many years now and have pretty much confirmed that i dont want to live in a society like this. I have most of my affairs in order its more just deciding how i want to go..

Please before commenting dont say how this will hurt the people around me etc.. i understand that. And do feel terrible about it. But feel that ultimately it is my choise wether i want to be alive. And this is not what i want this post to be about.

I guess in conclusion i wrote this not as a way to be talked out of my decision but more as a way to see that if anybody else feels kind of the same way and how they go about dealing with it? I'd really appreciate your input.",S

I'm at the point that I don't care about posting this on my main account, I'm disgusted by this society, specifically this culture I live in. A culture where I'm shunned for not thinking exactly the way others do, a culture where I'm made fun of for not finding someone who likes me back, and a culture of people that assume they know exactly how you feel and attempt to dictate how you should feel without ever walking a path similar to yours. I cry myself to sleep some nights. Sometimes I wish I could melt it all away, sometimes I wish I could just melt myself away.

234,"I have been having a really tough time lately. I won’t go into too much detail, but just know that my school work, my physical and mental issues (uncomfortable in my own body, short temper, not disabilities, but mental issues), my feeling like I don’t belong anywhere, impressing my parents and my depression and anxiety have all been weighing down on me.

Today, I’ve hit my breaking point. I have been stressed out and the only way for me to keep going was to have something to escape it all, gaming and watching YouTube on my computer. Today, I have been feeling awful, and my stress led my to hit my sister, not particularly hard or anywhere damaging, just on the leg. Me, being scared of my father, especially when I do something wrong, immediately knew I was fucked. I pleaded not to hurt me, and he threatened me and all kinds of things. My sister said she was fine because she was scared for me too, but my dad had none of it. He didn’t hurt me, but he barged in and took the wifi from my computer, only after I tried to reason him not to take it entirely. He said things that made me feel like I don’t belong in the family, I’m a disgrace and don’t deserve what I have.

Earlier, before the incident, I told him I wanted to end my life, and as usual, he got mad. However, this time he said I should do it, and he wouldn’t care.

I have no where to keep sane, nothing that will make me happy. I am at an all time low. No one will care if I end my life, which was the only thing that stopped me before, along with the fact that I’m afraid. I want to kill myself, I have nothing to live for, no future, only disappointment and stress. But I’m to much of a pussy. Sorry that you read this, you shouldn’t waste your time here.",S
235,"I can't do it anymore.

We've been together for 4 years. I love him, but he does not love me. Everything that I know is true about who I am, he has told me twice over. I am so selfish, and so incredibly useless. Every person I have encountered in my life knew that, too. 

He said I am retarded, lazy, selfish, a bitch.  I know he's right. I've known since I was small that whatever I am, I was not meant to be a person. I know in the core of my being that I was supposed to be something else, if anything at all. How are you supposed to go on knowing that you're nothing, and always will be? 

I'm 22 now. No education past high school. No job now that I'm laid off. No friends, save for one. The only person on this planet who truly cares about me is my sweet mother. I know it's time, but how do I leave her behind? How do I leave her behind when she is the only person who never left me behind? I am her only child. She sacrificed so much to make sure I had a home, clothing, food in my belly, and love.

***My boyfriend pressured me into an abortion and I actually did it. I can't bear the thought of living another day when I allowed myself to give into pressure and murder my own child. I know why he wanted it, and his feelings and needs are valid, particularly as he suffers from PTSD. Worst of all I felt similarly at the time. Maybe I thought I did? I don't know what's real anymore. I am so worthless and I'm wasting air that good, salt of the earth people could be breathing instead. My baby could be breathing it instead. They would've turned a year old last month. But I lkilled them before they even had a chance to experience actual life. Before I knew if they were a boy or a girl. Before they had a name. I looked at ultrasounds and watched tiny fingers and tiny toes moving. I listened to a healthy heartbeat. And I did it anyway. There is no coming back from this.

I'm sorry this probably doesn't make any sense and I don't know how to make it coherent. I feel like I'm inhabiting a body that doesn't belong to me. I love my boyfriend, despite his issues he is a good man on the inside. PTSD is cruel, and he's doing the best he can. When he is kind to me in return I feel content. But after today, I know that none of his kindness towards me was real. I know now that he felt guilty and obligated to stay with me after the D&amp;C. I know now that the small amount of financial assistance I was able to give was an additional factor. I have wasted his time, when he could have been with someone worth the effort. I will never forgive myself for taking his time. He could've spent this time recovering and going to treatment.

After a lifetime of failure. A lifetime of disappointing everyone. I know that I have to go. It's time.

I have a bottle of oxycodone 25mg and a bottle of cyclobenzaprine 10mg, and a very big bottle of vodka. If I take them all together, and make sure to ingest enough vodka- I think it will do the job. The only thing that would be worse than living another day would be if these pills fail.

244,"Today I made a hard decision. I had to cut out the only local friend I had out of my life. Communication was a big issue between us; he'd get back to me when he felt like it, and the intermittent messages ended up being swapped back and forth every 18 hours or so. He knew I didn't like it and that it wasn't meeting my needs, but I tried to respect his preferences. This would go on and off since we reconnected a year and a half ago (we used to be friends before). 

Currently in my life I'm going through a depression. I suffer from PPD and distress tolerance. Lonliness has been something I struggle with since childhood, and he was my last local friend, so I feel and am alone more than ever now. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and urges since childhood too, and they've become more frequent and intense - even today. My friend knew all this, and I tried to support him with his mental health as well. As a result of all that, though, this makes coping with this and not feeling hopeless about my future very, very difficult... To the point where I'm reaching out to strangers.

I have family that care about me, but always attempts to problem solve and criticize me in their efforts to help, which isn't effective. I have an amazing online friend, but he lives across the ocean and there's an 8 hour time difference, so there's some obvious obstacles there. I have difficulty making friends and I don't seem to illicit much interest from people. It's very easy to think there's something wrong with me.

I'm not sure what I want out of this post. Someone to talk to would be nice, but I know typically that lasts for a few days. Maybe just something to make experiencing this less painful for now.",S

249,"Okay I don’t want to live anymore. I’m struggling with an insane amount of anxiety related to work and health. Being unemployed for three months over this quarantine is driving me mad. 

These past few days I keep thinking about just ending it. I feel stupid for feeling like this because I am better off financially than many other people my age. 

The last year itself has been hell in many ways. A horrible breakup with an abusive ex, loss of one of my dogs, and a string of other failed relationships. Been written up at work for underperforming because of all the stress. 

Now because of the pandemic I haven’t been working in three months and I’m scared I won’t get my jobs back at all. 

I’ve been on medication for depression, anxiety and ocd for over a year now. It helps sometimes but when I’m low I get really low. 

I want to end it. But I don’t wanna imagine what that would do to my mother. And my remaining dog... who would take care and look out for her if I was gone. 
So I feel torn. I can’t stand this torture in my brain anymore.",S

I'm so extremely angry. People blame me for everything.,S

I wish I did more with the tools and opportunities I had at the time.

256,"here's whats up. 22, unemployed, not in school, very limited work history, severely obsessive compulsive with psychotic features, severely body dysmorphic (have been skirting the line of institutionalization as long as i can remember). too smart for my own good, brain is running circles around me, massive noise aversions, massive self loathing thoughts, constantly need to correct internal course. live with 5 other people, i love them, i can do nothing for them. i want to avoid irrationality in this post, not sure if i can help it. 

for the last week i have felt unable to do anything but vent and lash out. just when i think i can find equilibrium im disoriented and delusional again. my friends are in dire straits too, they are doing all they can for me, they say they love me and they are not hurt by me, i can give them nothing in return. i am terrified of them cutting contact with me, and it seems inevitable. i am overwhelming by nature, and i am a loud bitch, so when i have a problem i will go in circles over and over and drive the nail deeper.

2 of the people in my house (my parents) are immunocompromised and in their 50s, and i have massive fear of failure, so finding work or school is unrealistic until this pandemic is over and i am stable enough to not break down every day and quit after a month like i did at my last (first) job. i feel like the epitome of what america hates and vilifies, a useless lazy entitled greedy worm leeching taxpayer cash, and ugly like a pig too, and that is the mindset i would be going into any interview or placement test with. i am lucid enough to know that is unhealthy.

it drives me insane to know i have nothing to contribute, am impossibly ugly, and am broken emotionally and spiritually. i have worked so fucking hard to improve myself and my mental state and i am still in the same fundamental situation i was at 16. i am suicidal for the first time in four years. i am a coward, and thus deeply afraid of pain, so most methods are unattractive, plus the risk of doing it wrong and ending up an invalid with a ruined life does not seem worth it. if this goes on for another week my mindset may change. i cannot keep hurting my friends. i cannot keep hurting myself. it feels like the only way this will stop is long term intensive outpatient or inpatient, or death.

259,"It's hard to admit that your brain and thoughts are what hold you back, or make you sad, or stop you for going for what you want.

It's hard to admit that you have toxic traits. That it may not just be because they way you grew up ot the events of your life, that it's actually just yourself just getting in the way. Your own mind, keeping you in a comfortable misery. Keeping you in a place that you were used to surviving in and making things happen again because you believe that you don't deserve anything better. 

It's so hard to ask for help.

It's hard to let people in.

It's hard to say i love you...even when you know you'll never hear it back.

It's hard to say 'I'm sorry.' To keep the peace and to keep them in your life just a little longer.

It's hard to be told what a bad mother you are even when you try with everything you have.

It's hard to have any sense of confidence or love for yourself when the ones you care for tear you down, or don't say anything at all.

It's hard to feel everything so deeply, to love so hard when you're expected to play it cool. 

It's been hard to go through everyday, acting like everything will be okay, when inside you feel like dieing inside.

It's hard to have hope. 

It's hard to get up each day, knowing once again you won't be enough. You won't be pretty enough,  or smart enough, or funny enough, or cool enough, or enough of a partner or mother. 

Hard not to feel stupid for every attachment or emotion ypu have that annoy people around you.

It's hard not to physically feel your heart break everyday, hard to feel like you're grasping at love or another breathe to take. 

It's hard to feel like you could ever make a difference, or that you might be happy. One. Day.

It's hard not to just want it all to end...",S
260,"I graduated from college recently and I'm living with my parents. I can't stand being a worthless parasite much longer, so I've got 3 plans for the immediate future:

* **Sneakin' Out -** I'll bite the bullet and find a job - any job - away from here and sneak out from my parent's house. I'll only take what I can carry (I can't drive, so I'll bike to a train station). I'll probably die from a bad case of Not Knowing How Real Life Works, and it would also involve putting myself out there (Big Scary) and actually finding someone who would hire a guy with no experience during a pandemic.

* **The Military. Why Not? -** I'll apply for the Air Force, or maybe the Navy or something. With my degree, I should be able to get something. I know I'm perfect prey for the military (just out of college, shitloads of debt, no plans for the future), but at least it would get me out of the house and give me honors... or... something?

* **Into The Woods -** I basically live in a forest in the middle of nowhere, so I'll just take some beef jerky, a water filter, maybe a lightweight tarp, and just keep walking until I die from starvation, dehydration, extreme temperatures, exhaustion, or getting fuckin' eaten by a bear. At least it'll be a pretty place to die.

Of course, what I'm probably going to do is sit on my ass while my situation becomes worse and worse, but a man can dream (or at least fantasize until he goes fucking bonkers and shoots himself), right?",S
261,"I don't want to die. I'm just so fucking tired of seeing people's faces and my brain feels scrambled. My life if static. I need a break.

263,"The last8 years of my life has been hell. I’ve been dealing with a back injury that has progressively gotten worse over time. It’s the main thing that drives my suicidal tendency’s but with the last year I’ve lost my best friend. My other half. He was murdered in cold blood. That following week I lost my grand father and we held his funeral two weeks apart on the same day as my best friends funeral. The following month another good close friend died, I believe he killed himself.. with all that I hit rock bottom.. Atleast I thought I did, but just last month another close friend decided to end it all and OD on heroin.. that hurt me bad, but to top it off last week my uncle died of an heart attack.. I am rock bottom. I am the definition of a empty vessel. I wake up everyday Hoping that today is the day I die. I wake up everyday thinking about killing myself I wish I could. I’ve tried to get help with therapy, I’ve tried all the doctors for my back but being on state insurance they don’t want to cover anything in Kentucky. I work part time at the dollar general.. me and my girlfriend are taking a break after 3 1/2 years because she had been lying to me about insignificant things, such as taking diet pills that made her act as if she was on meth.. I just joined this group right now when I typed this up.. I’m not crying for help, I’ve cried all out for help I’m done. I’m basically in a sense writing this to leave behind a list or well an explanation to why I have done what I’ve done when I do it. I’m nothing but a waste of air, I don’t do anything productive, I don’t help anyone, I don’t do anything beneficial. I am the definition of a empty vessel. I am the definition of a waste of space. I am the true meaning of “watching it all slip through your hands”. I am the embodiment of all hope given up, lost and done. I’ve reached the end of my journey at 25 years old. I’ll be shocked if I make it to 26 “dec 20th bday” I’m honestly surprised I’ve made it this far, but not this time. I won’t keep letting how people feel keep me from doing what I want to do.

I've also been self-harming since the 6th grade. The earliest suicidal thought I can remember was around the 4th grade? I hate my body, I hate my face, I think of killing myself about 15 times a day. I've had anxiety attacks over outfits. Outfits.

I have no best friend, have never been in a romantic relationship. I'm honestly too worthless for someone to like me as more than an acquaintance. I've realized I'm just background noise in people's lives. Nobody reaches out to me, nobody talks to me on the regular.

I'm socially inarticulate and can't maintain relationships. I simultaneously crave validation and despise speaking to people. Honestly, I think I have bipolar disorder, because once in a blue moon, all of this is replaced by excessive glee. I feel happier, bolder, more confident. I've done risky things both online and off. I start new hobbies and make commitments and then leave everything half-finished when the high (mania?) comes down.

The only thing keeping me here is my immediate family, and yet I can't bring myself to ask for help. I just can't. My pride won't allow me. I won't be able to handle the look of disappointment on their faces.

Trust me people it’s not worth it! If you need help talk to someone and get help. Your never going to get better if you don’t try. I’m also open to talking to people if they need someone to let it all out and have appropriate responses. Again it is not okay to kill yourself, you could put your family and friends in a state where they are feeling depressed because you’ve become depressed and taken your life.

I’m planning on killing myself on Sunday, I’m just so confused and overwhelmed I really am done. Everything around me and inside me is so chaotic I feel like I have no where else to go except for my grave. 

I’ve been abused by my Narcissist dad since idk I was fucking born?? Of course I don’t remember my infant years and my (earlier) childhood is sort of a blur with just bits and pieces that I’m able to access, but I know and can still feel that most of it consisted of (and still does consist of) a heavy overwhelming weight always on my chest/shoulders. I’ve always had to make sure I was doing the right things, feeling the right feelings saying the right things,etc. I’ve had to live in a constant state of vigilance ever since I was young (even though I still am young, I’m only 15). I’ve had to (and still do to some extent) live like this in order to make sure I did my best to avoid setting of the raging Narc bomb that is my father. I’m in a constant state of fear and anxiety (diagnosed) as well as fluctuating (though constant) waves of major depression which is also diagnosed. It’s fucking horrible to live like this. I’ve developed zero sense of self and zero self confidence because I’ve always had to sacrifice parts of myself, mainly my emotional self in order to please and keep peace with my father and within the household. I can’t keep doing this, I can’t keep living like this. The pain I feel pierces so deep that I don’t even know where to start in processing it, and no matter how many days I spend trying to rebuild myself / being my own therapist by doing inner work so I can actually be a functioning human being, it always feels like my efforts are futile/done in vain because as soon as I step foot out of my room, the bullying and berating starts again. Sometimes I don’t even have to leave my damn room because he has zero sense of boundaries or privacy. Another win for me I suppose. I’m so worn down and worn out that I really think it’s just time for me to quit and give up. I really can’t fucking do this and/ or live like this anymore. I’m done. I’ve genuinely, after years of this, reached my limit. I’m empty and I don’t think I’ll ever be ""full"" again, it’s too hard, its too / feels too impossible. I feel like everything is working against me. I can’t anymore.

I wrote my dad a note that’ll he read upon my passing if I do decide to go through w suicide. It’s really harsh to say the least. I don’t wanna hurt him as much as I do hate/resent him, but after bottling up all these fucking emotions and after sacrificing my authentic self for all these years (my entire fucking life), It was inevitable that I was going to fucking explode and unavoidable for all my emotions that I’ve been hiding/ repressing to just burst out to the surface one day, it has to come out and it has to be expressed. Plus, after all these years of compliance and just taking the abuse, I think I have a right to be angry. I’m very hesitant, though.",S

i've been falling deeper and deeper into my depression for the last year. shitty friends made my anxiety, ADHD, and depression so vicious, and i dropped the ball on classes, extracurriculars, internships, and social relationships. this has then been compounded by the anxiety of human life being altered forever because of corona, and the dread that nothing will change in america after these protests. i want to go into politics: work on mitigating and adapting to climate change; making society more economically equitable; expanding democratic participation; addressing the institutional and systemic forces that have made life so shitty for so many people; building up public transit systems and renewable energy and public libraries and national parks and and and. do good in the world. but i need a college degree for that.

fucking up like this is making me so suicidal, actively researching things when i've never let myself in my other darker days. i just don't know how to claw myself out of this mess and graduate.

i'm passionate about things, i find pleasure in things, i know i am loved by people. i'm on medication and finding a therapist, starting to workout more because i know it's good for my brain. but i worry that my mental health will always make me struggle like this, that i'll have good periods but then fall back into The Pit, that blackhole of self-loathing and regret and self-imposed social isolation and 14-hour depression sleeps and being paralyzed by anxiety and fucking up my responsibilities because of it, which makes me fall even deeper. 

i'm just so afraid that life will always be like this, and so then i think killing myself now will just make it better. but then on the other hand, i want to live so i can experience the good periods and do good in the world. but then again, living is so much *work.* and i'm so tired. that bojack quote of ""every day it gets a little easier. but you gotta do it every day —that's the hard part. but it does get easier."" gets me through my darkest days, but then again i'll have to work hard every day to feel like a normal person. and that feels so exhausting. i just don't know what to do.

*here's a poem i wrote a few days ago. i think this slaps and i want it to be somewhere other than my hard drive if i do end up killing myself.*

&amp;#x200B;

**i carry the universe with me (i carry it in the world)**

i carry the universe with me (i carry it in

the world) i am never static (everywhere

all at once my mind is constantly expanding)

thoughts of the past, present, future,

dreams of peace, progress, future,

ideas of possibility, personhood, future

i fear

like the universe itself (and i, myself) these

swirling, dynamic, evolving, 

infinite, unsolved, existential,

realities will never be fully understood

realized. discovered. charted. known. (you know?)

before the inevitable end of existence

&amp;#x200B;

here is the deepest secret nobody knows

(i am afraid of dying, because i am afraid of living)

we may not know how the universe started

we may not know the reason for our existence

divine or darwinian, we have stardust in our lungs

celestial beings either way

i want to be like a star, existing

long after i’m gone

in the light emitted from my

thoughts, dreams, ideas

life

I feel shut off from the world-Detached.Just want to be happy and who I used to be,But when I try and talk to someone they have either pushed off or said it will get [better.So](https://better.So) I hide it which makes you feel really alone.

I recently got broke up with over text and I’m finding it hard to get over my ex as it was so out of the blue which is probably making me feel worse however I’ve felt like this before hand too. 

I’ve also always struggled with acne which has made me feel my worst and I just can’t be happy with the way I look and I also see myself as having a really uneven face .I constantly wish I looked like someone else . I find it hard to talk to my friends about this because I put on such a front that I’m happy all the time and I don’t want to put my problems onto them and I feel bad talking about how I truely have felt with my mum as I know she worries about me so much , and I have such a good family so I don’t know why I feel like this I don’t know what to do but I want to change",S

it's a loop at this point. i drink, i wake up the next day feeling like shit and regretting my mistakes, so i drink again to forget..

i lost all my hobbies. nothing brings me joy anymore besides drinking, drugs and sex. i'm not even living anymore, i'm just surviving. i don't have any goals left, no reason to be alive besides my loved ones. i used to study a lot, i was working towards getting a good education so i could succeed professionally, i loved computer science so that's why i applied for a computer science college. i made it into college and now, it doesn't even phase me. i'm not passionate about studying anymore.

I feel like always I have a destiny to fulfill or my parent's expectancy to be something that I can never reach,  My parents remind me always that I can just quit school if I want to and compare me to something better if I make one insignificant mistake. I've been wanting to kill myself for 3 years now, ever since year 7 or Grade 7 because my classmates bullied me for mistaking an event where someone snitched on memes we created, and later they found out who snitched on the memes but still continued anyway.  I confess that I took all of their insults very seriously and almost never tried to ignore them but I shut myself up and just kept them inside.  I know that there are people with worse conditions than me, far worse and I pity them for being in multiple situations, I am almost turning 13 in 17 days (Date right now is 12/10/20) and I know that once my teenage years come, I will keep these problems and make it worse over time, I try to forget them but everyone just reminds me of them. I have a need to look everywhere and think that everyone has a bad reputation for me, everyone is watching is what I think.  If I try to talk about these problems to my parents, they will say bullshit to me and punish me for saying such things, even my best friend whom I've known from Year 2 or Grade 2 almost ignores my problems, spread them among everyone, and turns them into a joke.

I used to have hopes and ambitions but they've all just been eroded. I used to want to be an illustrator or animator, pursuing that as a career just sucked the enjoyment out of it. And it didn't even leave me with a viable career.

Now I'm in an every level job, surviving okay but just nowhere near where I wanted to be. Stuck having to rent rooms in friends houses because I can't afford a place of my own. Feels like earning more money is unlikely as I simply don't have any passion or drive to further my career. Nothing interests me that much.

I bounce off hobbies that I used to enjoy. I sometimes go to bed at 7pm, not because I'm tired, but just because there's no point in staying up. I very occasionally find something to give me a brief, fleeting, temporary distraction but then it's gone.

I just want to switch my mind off. I'm sick of contemplating the future and just seeing a void devoid of any hope. I literally can't imagine ever being realistically able to afford a place of my own, I literally can't imagine being realistically able to retire.

I'm probably going to live for another 40 odd years, maybe longer, and that thought just depresses me more than anything. 40 years of this. I wish I'd never been conceived. But that's a moot thought.",S

Although I am putting the work for most of a decade now to adapt myself into a lifestyle in which I might be able to sustain myself and find some chance of stability, the though of suicide brings comfort and a sense of control. I always go back in small burst of optimism to a more bright look at the future for short moments but in reality I know how much I have come through and how much is still to come pretty much my whole and I find comfort in knowing that maybe I can choose to go through that or not.

So why even bother posting? Yeah ok I suppose there is something in me that doesn't really want to die. That's just survival instinct though. I need to pacify it a little before I can finally leave.

The universe just doesn’t want to fucking give me happiness and I always have to deal with the trauma that people gave me. I’m so fed up and want to scream at somebody. But I can’t because “oh they don’t want you to die because that’s selfish and you’ll hurt people “ like wow fucking genius it’s not like you people have it to me in the first place. Idk what’s wrong with me that I have the desire to punch something. I have never felt this and I’m afraid that I will explode and hurt myself. I’ve already relapsed 2 weeks ago and the feeling to do it is getting stronger and stronger. I feel really alone in a world where I have no desire to even be a part of. I hate my career prospects, I hate my situation and I hate everyone for hurting me.  If I were to die then those feelings would be gone.  Sorry for the rant ;((",S
350,"i cant sleep. this has been going on for 2.5 months since my elevated PSA flagged further tests. my PSA is 4.1 but fpsa is 11 (bad) and 4k score is 21%. the mri for this morning is cancelled because they dont have authorization. not sleeping makes me sulky and emotional. ive called suicide hotline and my sister. people tell me to fight this. i dont want to give up my health and sexuality due to radical prostatectomy, radiation and chemical castration. im ok with being dead but afraid of the doctors appts and treatments and diminishing quality of life. id rather be finished but told my sister id wait until my father dies before suicide. im afraid of suicide but not so much being dead. i pretty much got done what i wanted in this life. i watched a video of a guy in washington state doing assisted suicide with people around. im scared to do it. if i dont treat this will become bone cancer, which is considered among the most painful.",S

352,"I haven't talked to the person who used to be my only friend since February. I did something extremely hurtful while trying to share something I thought was ridiculous but funny. This was the last straw of me being careless, and they dropped all modes of contact. I texted them once a few months later to say I was doing okay and to wish them well, because I was planning to kill myself and didn't want them to worry. It was dumb, and I never got a response. 

I want to be able to talk to them one last time to try and apologise and tell them what their friendship meant to me. However, my very existence is probably enough to annoy or anger them, much less empty platitudes and unreciprocated emotions. I also don't want the last thing from my mouth to be a guilt trip or burden. They are the only person I have to farewell, but I can't, shouldn't and probably won't.

I don't see myself carrying on much longer. I'm stuck in a dead-end job in a faultering economy and a dying planet. Being transgender/ non-binary has killed nearly all dating and friendship prospects, and being a boring, pessimistic dickhead doesn't help. I have no support network, no more friends, a million neuroses, and no hope for a decent tomorrow.",S

354,i really want to kill myself,S
355,"I want to die. No, I'm actually thinking of killing myself. That is my purpose in life. To die. Once I die I will have fulfilled my purpose. But only if I die by suicide. I've told numerous people of my depression, anxiety and unhappiness. What did it get me. Well I lost more and more people. Its just like it says in the dsm-5. People get uncomfortable with it. People don't love misery, that's a terrible saying that company loves misery. They avoid it like the plague. People don't really care unless they can just say they help but no one ever does. They try, try once. But after that it's all my problem, my sickness, my issues. I've tried to get help and go to therapy. The system failed me over and over and over again. Everyone just has bandaid solutions and ""helps"" when convient. Doctors, therapists, pharmacists, psychiatrists, employers, friends and family, some have tried but no one has followed through. That's all they ever teach go find and send them to get help, that's how you deal with sudicdal, depressed persons. So that's what everyone does. No one will truly take me seriously until I commit suicide and ""succeed"". I've had numerous suicide fails now. I've tried pills and slitting my throat. Both I survived, back to this never ending anguish. I'm too functional to be suicidal and taken seriously. Again it's my fault though. I have to find the hope, hope that I'll just magically change and be OK enough to want help. I do. I've asked for it many times and it always comes back empty. So what are you supposed to do when you are in my position. You're too much of a coward, soft piece of shit to kill yourself and succeed. But also slightly able to appear like you're functioning that no one will take you seriously about being suicidal, majorly depressed and overwhelmed with anxiety. Even though there are clear signs like cuts along my neck, I've confided in you that I'm depressed and on/off suicidal, and I'm always a fucking downer in your life and probably everyone else's. Someone please tell me. Oh and I've already had 1/2 of my mental health sessions of the year from work but they're still working on referring me to someone else who will better suit my needs. Still no one has gotten back to me. Again, this is my fault. I have to want help. Indirectly and directly asking for help and nothing received long term, I'm just having a rough time in this one moment and I just need to let go and get over it then all my problems will be solved. Right? Well so far the only way to solve my issues most successfully was by the suicide attempts. So when I get the courage to try again, I will have served my purpose. ",S
356,"Does anyone else feel like this? I love my children dearly and I would never hurt them but I wish I didn’t have them because it makes leaving this hell hole so much harder. If they weren’t here I would have already gone. I feel so bad for them having to witness with my mental health struggles and for them not to have a “normal, happy” mum like all the other kids. I try to shelter them as much is possible from it all but they have noticed all the scars on my arms and are starting to ask questions. So for now I will sit here planning the best way to go so I have it perfected and I will take peace in that.",S

358,I'm done my life is falling apart. This would now be my eight suicide attempt and I feel like absolute shit. I was supposed to get sent to a residential but my mom is leaving tomorrow because she can't deal with my family. My grandpa is in the hospital dying and it pains me to see my dad sad. I've lost all my friends no one takes talks to me anymore. My heart feels like it's slowly stopping I've lost 17 pounds in 2 weeks and relapsed on my eating disorder. My brother is using again and he's deathly ill and skinny and it kills me to see him like this and my parents aren't doing anything about it. But tomorrows a new day to try again I don't want to be in this world anymore. I'm useless and a pathetic nobody. goodbye guys.,S
359,"I guess I'm coming here again because I've just had a meltdown &amp; I don't want to show anyone I care about anymore of that. I'm just regretting now telling my online friends about my irl issues &amp; how bad they are. I know they're going through a hard time &amp; I feel so selfish &amp; guilty. I keep getting worse though &amp; they're the only ones who seem to care. It's hard keeping everything inside &amp; I tried looking positively at my situation. In reality though I'd have to be crazy to think it's not bad which is ironic, bcause I guess I am technically crazy. 

I feel like I just need to kill myself to end my own suffering. Why has everything in my life gone so badly? It seems the only thing that hasn't are my online friends who I keep dumping my baggage on. I'm afraid of losing them more then anything, especially more specifically my best friend. 

Disappearing sounds so good now before anything gets worse before I lose my best friend. 

I can feel myself close to doing something I'll regret, it's like I'm going to explode. I don't want to be a bad person anymore, is that what I have to be for any relief?",S

Not having enough time for yourself and being tired all the time. 
What’s the point of trying for relationship ships when they all go down the drain anyways . 
I posted here a while ago and people say things get better . But yet things seem more bleak than ever and I have this odd feeling of not even fearing suicide anymore . I feel more happy in my resolve of not being here then any form of “satisfaction” you’d gain from hobbies and working out and other useless advise you get.

I wanted to deactivate or maybe, leave a little bit. Life is so, so boring to me. The world has got a grey filter on it. I don't even know what the point is anymore :))

In light of everything that’s been happening in this world, there is no doubt that there will be uncertainties in every aspect you can think of. I’m well aware that I’m not the only one going through this. I just don’t know how to feel better. Everyday just gets worse. 

I have been praying several nights for these thoughts to simply go away, but as you guessed, it’s not working. I try to distract myself by watching shows but then a minute later those thoughts come back so I end up laying in bed, wondering if I would be better off ending my existence just so that I wouldn’t have to suffer with these thoughts every single day anymore. It’s draining the life out of me. It’s affecting me and everything that I do. I have been experiencing urges to hurt myself completely, I just can’t push myself to do it because I have a family and a girlfriend that supports me.

My friends invited me out tonight and kept telling me they were gonna text me when to come and they just ghosted me. My ex who cheated on me after 2 years added me online on my birthday, and i was gonna forgive her but she just added me to mess with me and make fun of me with her new boyfriend. Nobody fucking likes me and ive tried everything. I cant do anything right. Last time I tried to kill myself people just got mad at me and how it was an inconvenience to look for me in the middle of the night. I was all ready for a night out with some friends, and since I want to make better friends because my close ones are drug addicts. I was all dressed up and ready to go meet new people. But fuck me i guess. After all that i tried to play some games and i got onto among us, which is a fun game. I started talking to people and it seemed like it was going well. Then they banned me. I actually started fucking crying. I havent cried since I was a child. And here I am, making a post on reddit because I want people to know that I am dead. Thanks to everyone who treated me like shit. Im so fucking sad, all the work ive put into bodybuilding, football, and, well I dont have any fucking talent. all my work gone, but it doesnt matter because no one cared anyways. The worst part about my ex cheating was that she was travelling, and that I was super worried something had happened to her but no she was having the time of her life getting fucking destroyed by her ex. She wasnt even sorry. I just wanted to make friends while I was alive, why is everyone so fucking mean. It seems like its so easy for other people to make friends because when I do the same shit it doesnt fucking work. I am not going to do this anymore. Thanks to anyone who read through this. I cant imagine anyone caring enough to read this though. I dont know how I can be such a fucking failure. I dont even need my parents to but they tell me anyways that they are disappointed. Well, if i do go to heaven, maybe ill see you guys there someday. I always imagined when i was younger as a city in the clouds and I imagined dead loved ones being able to do what they loved most and never getting bored. As a kid,  i would imagive my granddad playing golf in the clouds. He still had the bag to hold piss from kidneys, but I think that he wouldnt have that. And he is probably playing golf right now. When I get to heaven I am going to drive on a street in the dark, while its raining and my music on. Love yall. Thanks for taking time out of your day to read a pathetic losers post. :)",S

The fear of failure has kept me from doing it so far with the small gun I have, a rope, benedryl, slitting my wrists, driving off a bridge, etc. If/when I do this, I'm going to do it right the first time.

I was recently prescribed hydrocodone / acetaminophen 7.5-325 T for a broken leg (accidental believe it or not).  It just occurred to me that this could be another out. Does anyone have any overdose stories they can share?  Honestly, reddit has been the best place for me because of how much people have shared here.

I feel like I can’t even be completely honest because I don’t want to be committed. The truth is I hate life and I wish it would end. I self harmed after years of not doing it. I feel ashamed. My dad has been dead for years and I’m still mad at him. But what if he just abandoned me because he knew I wasn’t anybody? What if he knew the whole time that I was worthless?

It’s my first year uni and it’s not going to hot to be honest. In a high class family of people who are organized and who are naturally smart someone has to be the odd duck right? Well guess that’s my place. I feel like everything I do is just a complete joke or failure. Fuck at this point I could even say that about my life. An hour ago I put a pipe on the top of my door and wedged it so it couldn’t move, I put a belt on it and tried pushing my head through. I couldent succeed. It’s a lot harder then how it looks in movies or even how one would assume a self hanging would go. I then went and sat in my chair and held my samurai sword to my stomach, I thought I could pull one of those samurai moves but no, it’s too much work and I guess I’m not that strong minded. Fuck ok sorry guys for the butchered post, it’s disorganized and hard to follow it’s kinda like my mind and my thought process it reminds me of that song paranoid by black sabbath, just a fit of rage and paranoia.

I havent been myself in a long time, I think of commuting suicide almost every minute of every day, I feel like I’m being haunted by the thought of a pistol being put against my temple and I’m the one who’s doing it, I feel hollow, empty inside, I feel a sense of detachment that I think only people who have reached the peak of suicidal can feel and If you are reading this it means I pushed myself off the ledge of that peak
Family, what does family mean, to me it means absolutely let nothing, I don’t think I can talk to my family, when I tried to hang myself my mother came off as threatening, like she was going to put me in an institution, and I was gonna rot on antidepressants and antipsychotics for as long as they kept me sedated, a walking puppet, no real emotion just a lost soul that someone threw in the trash, my father, I don’t think he’s ever actually cared about me, every time he talks to me it has something to do with insurance and diabetes, like his wallet is taking a beating while my disorder is making me sick and unable to enjoy life to the fullest, both of my brothers act like they care but it’s all a facade, the admirable oldest brother, in the public’s eye he’s like a shining star, I would say that’s what his viewpoint of himself is, he’s shallow, he would throw anybody under the bus for attention, he makes me fucking sick, a disposable person, he only cares about himself and he lies about everything, and My middle brother, the man who has tried to stray from everything, he really doesn’t care about anyone in the family, he’s self absorbed, he along with Hank thinks he’s better than everyone else, they’re all sickening, I can’t bare any of them, but what about me, I’m the one writing this note right? What have I done, what are my flaws? The fact that I’m writing this makes me far from the perfect person, I’ve got baggage, and I’ve got a lot of it, I finally tried to look for help, I finally reached out and I got nothing, like I always do, I’m narcissistic, pessimistic, I don’t care about politics, I try to care about other people but I’ve drawn the short stick so many times I could care less, I still want to care but I’ve been living a lie my entire life, what can I do, I’ve tried so hard to fit in, I’ve tried so goddamn hard to be normal like everyone else, I’m tired of it, I’m not normal, I’m different and it’s not a good thing, I’m the worst of all of them and I’ve tried to be the best I possibly could to everyone, what a waste of time, I hate everyone, I’m tired of pretending like I don’t, I’ve been dragged through the mud, walked all over, kicked in the dirt, and I’m tired of it, I tried to make my stand but I’m stuck under a mountain of debt, and if I ever left I wouldn’t be able to afford my diabetic medication, but it’s okay I’ve got another way out, but being raised in the church has made me terrified of it, why shouldn’t I do it?

Why shouldn’t I just kill myself, I feel like I’m being tortured by my emotions, I can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t feel happy, I just want it to end, I’m tired of it I gave it a try and now that I’ve failed it’s time to wrap up this shit show and get a move on, I’m tired of being alive, some people may read this and think I’m being dramatic, I’ve been told I come from a dramatic family, I feel like I want to blow my brains out and some people say I’m being dramatic to that, oh well right I’m just another statistic I guess. Or how about the ones who wanna tell me killing myself is selfish, yeah it’s really selfish to take away the person that you don’t wanna help through their problems right, it’s really easy to tell someone not to do something, I wanted help while there was still a chance, I’m not selfish for doing this, your selfish for not helping when I was so desperate for it that I even asked, I’m not selfish, my life doesn’t fucking belong to you, and if it did you haven’t been taking good care of it at all, I’m not selfish for wanting the pain to go away, I’m not selfish for asking for help, your selfish for turning away in my time of need, your an asshole, you’re a fucking prick, and even though I want to kill myself and let my life be a memory that will be forgot in the blink of an eye, I still can’t help but wish things were different, and for some reason I still feel bad putting you through this, I don’t know why I do but hey, I guess that’s what makes me human right, and I guess that’s why I’m having trouble doing the dead, but this lights flickering and it’s about to go out, I’m sorry it had to end like this, I’m just so fucking sorry that things ended up this way, I really do wish they could be different, I’m gonna sit here and think about it for a while, but I don’t know how much time I got left",S

When I look into the future, I see this massive void of nothingness. Of just going to work, to go home and lie in bed. I used to daydream, things might get better. But even those dreams have gone away. I don't think of anything. I just stare. 

I've never done anything special with my life, god knows I'm a failure with relationships. So much so to the point I don't even want one anymore. How can I trust someone else when I don't even understand what's wrong with me anymore? 

Even when things got bad with family and I stepped up to help in a massive way, worked my hardest to help someone who ended up in hospital and spent almost $1k on parking over 5 months on visits to try to help them. I still ended up failing. That person, although mentally deficient now, even saying they hated me.

I can't escape this constantly feeling of worthlessness. It's not even that I ""Think"" I'm not going to amount to anything, I know it. It's there. Persistent. A constant daily reminder that my entire existence is a waste of literally EVERYONE'S time, including my own. 

I don't know how I'll do it. When I'll do it. I don't think it works like that anyway. It's just I know it's coming soon. I have to go. This isn't the right time for me to ""Be"". Clearly my entire life is a mistake.",S

I can go four days staying awake and I never had an appetite when I can't sleep so I don't eat either but now after telling him this as a result he took me off all of my sleeping medication.

He put me on some kind of antidepressants that are also for anxiety but not meant for anxiety alone. I already told him when I don't sleep I have suicidal thoughts and right now it's really bad. I've tried cbd, I've tried over the counter medication, I've tried gravol, anti-nausea medicine, anything, it's even come down to me drinking beer they get that sense of feeling tired a little lately that hasn't been working.

Now I'm just at a loss because I know this is only going to get worse because I'm not going to be able to sleep and my mind is already in that place and I'm only two to three days in. 
Another thing about the medication I was put on, it can take up to 6 weeks to actually have effects.

Btw, i am suffered from depression and anxiety about half a year. I also have ASD (Asperger's) i think i am smart but i don't have any good skills that everyone have. When i saw someone doing something like chopping wood, building the robot or doing something hard it makes me feel bad because im really suck and can't improve myself i don't know why but i tried and failed almost everytime. I also have low social skills, have few friends and i hate talking on the phone or open a facecam. Lately, i feel guilty af and blame myself every single day.

Luckily, my family saw me lay on the bed and i look depressed my mom asked me ""You look sad. Did you want to see a doctor?"" something like this i think. This makes me feel a bit better my mind said ""Finally! someone actually understand me"" i take a pill everyday and it's actually feel better than before.

Yeah for me my family aren't my friends. I want a real friend, who is actually cares me and not just being a stupid friend who always said ""It will be better"" ""You are not alone"".

Recently, i talk to my friend a lot about problems i faced. She is my best friend ever. She helps me many times. She actually listened to my problems and give me a good advice. Sometimes, she dm to me and to give me a hope and power even it's almost disappeared. When i depressed or have suicidal thought, i always talk to her first and i feel better and have less negative thoughts. Thanks

438,"I'm about to fail at least two of my classes, which means getting kicked out of school for 2 semesters. This has happened before, but I dropped out of the semester before it was too late and came back 1 semester later. 

When it happened the first time, I was sure I was going to end my life. Wrote a note and everything. When I didn't and came back, for a second things were actually getting better but clearly that's no longer the case.

I have nothing going for me anymore, and I'm about to get kicked out of my school (again), which probably means losing my summer internship. I go to an Ivy uni and the pressure to do good when I'm just a lazy horrible failure is immense.

I feel like I'm just one of those people who don't have what it takes to remain here on this Earth; I am not an enduring individual. I've been suicidal a lot of my life and self harm deliberately where no one can see. I've always thought that I'd die by suicide at some point.

So I'll finish this group project for Zoom University (can't leave the team hanging), bring my friend a housewarming gift, clean up my room so my parents don't have much to do, and then take every pill I can find with some vodka. There's just no feasible path forward from this failure (again).

439,"As a result of my incompetence and failure to be a good man AGAIN (I hate myself for it) I killed my relationship which was the only good thing I had going for me. I felt like I had finally met my person but again I was too proud or stubborn and egotistical to address my issues. In my relationship ending the way it did and the way that the I handled the situation, my housemates then told me they didn't want me to live there anymore and to be honest if I was to stay there I'd be struck with reminders everywhere of what had happened between me and my SO. Because of what happened with me and my SO I've also lost all but 2 friends in the town where I had created some sorry excuse of a life for the last 3 years.

Because of all this I was uprooted really abruptly (space of a few days) and left that house and am now back home with my parents. I have some friends around the area of my parents home (where I grew up) and I've been relying on them very heavily.  The thing is my parents are moving house in Jan so I expect to be uprooted again and where they're moving is insanely tucked away, away from anyone that I know and I know that I'll feel really isolated.

Having opened up lines of communication with my (ex) SO, she told me how badly I'd messed up in specific details e.g. things I'd done and said and how despicable my behaviour was- which was what I needed to hear in order to improve as a person and i truly do want to. But it also made me notice that my entire life has just been me always being the bad guy, the one that does wrong and that nobody thinks can do differently. A string of failed relationships and being too flipping proud to speak about problems I am battling in my head until they explode in ways that have nothing to do with anything OR i act insanely recklessly, to the point of madness with NO regards to anything or anyone.

Last week on Thursday 10th after processing and then reflecting on everything that had gone on, I just couldn't sit by and watch myself kill anymore relationships or friendships the way that I did with my ex, especially since the one person that could help me make a change wants nothing to do with me anymore. I made the decision to commit and I wrote a note and sorted my belongings by whom I wanted to give them to. The cord broke above my head and I failed. 

I now have a zoom meeting at 5pm with my personal tutor at uni because one of my lecturers contacted her to get in touch with me because she was concerned and I will tell her about my current circumstances but i'm really reluctant to talk about this attempt because I don't know what's going to happen if I do mention anything.

I found aspirin and ibuprofen today. I think I will overdose next week, when our school has a two-day holiday because of Christmas. Nobody will be home except my little brother, he'll be playing games anyways, he won't suspect a thing. If I can't overdose, I'll put a plastic bag over my head, tape it to my neck - making an airtight seal and taping my hands on my back right after. Only thing I am concerned is the possibility of failing. If the former method fails, I'll probably bleed my stomach or have hearing problems. If the latter happens however, I'll probably have permanent brain damage. If I find sleeping pills, I'm definitely going for aspirin+ibuprofen.

I also have another problem - I'm a fucking coward so I don't have the balls to do it to be honest. If these ways prove to be %100 effective and mostly painless however, I am going for it.

Does anyone know anything about taking ibuprofen+aspirin? I think I have around 1.7 grams of aspirin and 2 grams of ibuprofen, though the latter is in liquid form. Should I use this as a reliable way of suicide? Will it be painful? How long will it take? Can I use them after taking sleeping pills or just before sleeping at night? Also, is the plastic bag method painful? How long does it take and is it reliable? Thanks in advance if you can answer.

Please don't tell me that people care or whatever. I know they don't and I am %100 dedicated. By not helping, you are just increasing my risks of having many more problems (for example permanent brain damage). Thank you to everyone who helps in advance.",S

I can’t say what they want to hear when they are upset. I say what I would want to hear or what I think would be best. And apparently I get it wrong more often than not.  But it’s not like I’m not trying, I am trying so hard to say the right things. 

My wife is grieving the loss of her mother. She stays in bed more often than not. She is no longer connected to day to day life. It’s been five months. I don’t want her to “just get over it”, but I want her to get out of bed. I want her to start living again. 

But now I’m this big asshole. This big giant asshole who can’t imagine whatever it would be like to lose a parent. I am uncaring and horrible. And now her entire family has turned against me, literally coming here to yell at me. I am now officially the villain. The worthless son in law. 

But I swear I am just worried she is falling down a downward spiral and unable to break free. 

And now here I am, alone, my own family a million miles away. No friends, just a few acquaintances. 

Captain Depression of Suicidal Thought Team Six. Every time I face this kind of shitshow, all I can think is I don’t want to be here any more. I want to find some conceivably-was-an-accident solution and just be done. Probably with my car and some kind of inanimate object. 

What I really day dream about is worse. I just want to go for a hike, down in the gorge. And just keep walking. Take a wrong turn. Get lost, deeper and deeper into the bush. Just keep going, sleep for awhile when I get tired, and then get up and go deeper. Until I’m so far down the Nattai River Gorge it’ll take a good long time to find my remains. “He just got lost hiking.”

But I know I can’t do this. I can’t do this to my own family, an ocean away and unable to come here to claim me. I can’t do it to my wife, already this deep in grief.

There is no way out of this mess. I have proven that I’m incapable of having a life worth living. I don’t want to do anything. Crippling depression is real as fuck it seems. If not I’m a lazy piece of shit that doesn’t deserve to live anyway.

I have also been lying to my girlfriend about my life for the past 2 years. I met her abroad and told her I had a better life. I pretty much lied to her about everything in the first paragraph except my age. We have been together several times since abroad and have been in a long term relationship when apart.

She is suffering badly from us being apart. She has been trying to get a visa to come to me but I can’t make it work.

So, today, when I get home from school, I'll find the best method available to me and end it. I can't do this anymore.",S
485,"It feels like my entire life is just crumbling around me. I understand that in hindsight to some this'll sound very dramatic, and I do apologise if I come across as a drama queen. I just need to get this out there. 

Firstly, I'm too stupid for university. That isn't me being self-deprecating — it's just factual. I'm not looking for anyone to debunk this, or feed me false platitudes. I'm stupid. I've been stupid throughout my whole academic career. Don't get me wrong — I write well. Like, really well. Give me a prompt and I'll spit out the most poetic, imaginative shit. In terms of everything else, however, I'm stupid. I can't do maths, or science, and overall I just detest the education system. 

Having said that, I'm struggling in the realms of work. I understand given COVID-19 more or less everyone is, but what I mean is, essentially every job I've ever had I've never been able to hold down. I don't understand why — or I partially do (mental health) but that reason in itself isn't good enough. I can't keep depending on my mum to home me. I'm trying to compensate by giving token rent, cleaning, buying necessities etc, but it doesn't feel like enough. I can't hold full-time work down, or if I can then it absolutely has to be minimal interaction with the general public. I'm currently a cleaner and although I know it's all about happiness and wellbeing, I just feel inferior and a disappointment in the eyes of society.

Furthermore, I'm absolutely convinced I'm unlovable. I've never, ever had a partner; never even had that dating experience throughout secondary/A-Levels. I'm not ugly-ugly, but *average*. I have a pretty bad case of baby-face. Overall I just feel I'll never find anyone. I don't have any friends either. 

Right now I'm trying to take baby steps, i.e. use the wage from my cleaning position to fund driving lessons and maybe therapy etc, etc — but it's so fucking hard. I look around me and while I understand looks can be deceiving, I'm just gutted that I can't fake it like everybody else does. I wish I could, and yet I can't even do that. I'm exhausted all the time. I've been doing everything by the rule book, i.e. exercising, better nutrition, medication, CBT etc. None of this is working and so I struggle to believe I'll ever be able to make it past the age of 25, let alone 30.

I lay in our bed awake some night just crying and begging whatever power there is out there that she'll come back to me. The depression is weighing so heavily on me and it's making me so incredibly suicidal again. I wanna start cutting again because of just how stressed I am. I have thoughts about starting to drink and drown my pain in booze. It hurts so fucking much and the only way anything is ever going to feel good again is if she gets back together with me. I'm sick and tired of people telling me that I'll find somebody else. I DON'T FUCKING WANT ANYBODY ELSE. I WANT HER. SHE'S MY SOULMATE. She's the girl who holds a huge part of me. I used to think I'd settle for something mediocre, like a crappy job and a partner that would kinda care about me and just kinda live a half assed life, but since meeting her I decided I wouldn't settle for mediocre. I want her, I want a life with HER. I wanna wake up next to her again, hear her blasting her EDM music at 7 in the morning, make her nachos after work, joke about who's farts stink more while we stay up late and just talk and screw around.

The second one gives me time to say goodbye, to tell my friends that there’s nothing they could have done and to tell my crush how I feel. that ones probably best, though my last few moment will be incredibly uncomfortable and painful. 

The problem, and the reason I haven’t done it yet, is that I’m Muslim. So suicide = hell. 

Yeah instead I’m just kinda going around with something of a disregard for my life punching walls and shit. I’m not really sure what to do.

I feel so lonely and isolated. I’ve always dreamed of living a normal life. Is there anyone in the same situation?

I’m currently in high school. I have almost no friends. My only friends are the ones from primary/secondary school but they also seem to prefer their new friends and they probably don’t care about me anymore.

The only thing I can be proud of is that I’m doing well academically in school and my teachers and classmates sometimes compliment me for that. I was told by my teachers that I’m gifted. But that means nothing to me since I’m almost certainly destined to continue struggling with so many things forever because of my autism. I always feel a barrier between my peers.

At least when I was in primary school I had a more decent life and I actually had friends so I want to go back to that time if I could. Back then I didn’t struggle with maintaining relationships that much and had self-esteem. 2015 was the best year of my life. Then I gradually began struggling with normal things and around that time I realized this is because of my autism. But I can’t seek professional help because my father doesn’t believe autism exists.

I have no future. 85% of people with Asperger’s are unemployed. And even if I could somehow get a job I’ll probably be bullied by my colleagues because of my poor social skills so there’s little chance I’ll survive. I don’t want to be an adult. I’m jealous of normal people. I want to be able to do normal things. I wish I had never been born. I don’t feel like I’m needed by anyone and the only thing I can do is for me to go.

526,"I've had several periods in my (relatively-speaking young, I'm late-20's) life where I've been utterly, horribly depressed and up to about 7.5/8/8.5 on the Emmengard Scale for months on end.

One thing I noticed about my thought patterns during those times, in retrospect, was a constant circle around ""This, that, and that other thing are really awful in my life, but at the core of it all, even if those were gone, I just don't want to live any more and nothing gives me joy."". I felt like happiness and myself were fundamentally incompatible concepts and the fact that I was going through stressful events was just ancillary to that situation.

I would have random bouts of crying from nowhere about no particular conscious cause. I didn't want to do anything. The most I had to look forward to were times when bad things, like work, were temporarily relieved like on the weekends, but even weekends became less and less different from work. Hobbies became work. Fun became work. Everything became work. Nothing was good.

Something I came to realize after dipping into and out of these periods in my life is that stress *poisons* your mental well-being. I had thought that, if my depression was being made worse by the stressful situations I was undergoing, that it would be accompanied with thoughts like ""I would enjoy this fun thing, but I keep thinking about this stressful thing and it makes me unable to enjoy this fun thing.""

It **isn't** accompanied with those thoughts. People who have never been depressed think that it is because that is the way it manifests itself in people who aren't depressed. That is not how stress manifests itself in a depressed person.

Stress has a way of getting into the very fiber of your being and poisoning everything you enjoy while being completely imperceptible as it does so. You don't even end up thinking about the stress and it still seeps its way in. ""I didn't even think about the stressful situations the entire night, but I was still miserable.""

I started rationalizing things as ""These periods where I'm undergoing this stressful thing are bad, but I feel ever so slightly better when I'm away from those stressful things, so that means that the weight of that thing is small compared to my baseline depression."". I started (incorrectly) rationalizing my depression and it wasn't a good thing.

I am an extremely introspective person. I'm constantly trying to understand how my brain works and where my gut reactions come from and why I have the emotions that I do or why I don't have the emotions that I should. That fact did absolutely **nothing** to help me realize that the stress was poisoning my life while I was in those periods of despondant depression.

I frequently found ways to distance myself from the stressful situations or sometimes even resolve it for an temporary period. That's not enough. It takes a long, long time to recover from chronic stressful situations. Those periods actually sometimes ended up doing more harm than good for me because I'd say to myself ""See? Stressful situation gone. Absolutely nothing stressful for me to deal with for the next month or few months and I'm still depressed. The stress was not affecting (or the cause of) my depression."". The worst thing is when people who haven't dealt with depression will think that those temporary periods might make you ""see the light"" and be happy again. Frequently, they make things worse because they just ""prove"" to you that the stress wasn't the cause.

When I finally found myself a way of getting out of the stressful situation **permanently**, things got ""better"" for me. Not ""better"" like everyone says they get ""better"". You know when you see a video of someone getting injured extremely severely and you think ""If they're not dead, they probably wish they were.""? Getting better after leaving a stressful situation is a lot like that. It takes months, and often, years away from those stressful situations before things start to improve. It's not like ""a week of bedrest and that injury will heal"". It's not a broken arm. It's like when you see someone recovering from a head injury and having to relearn how to walk. They might learn well enough to go hiking again, but they will probably have a permanent limp, but that might actually be okay enough and eventually they'll stop noticing the limp as much.

I'm not going to promise that that will happen for you. Every person is different. Every type of depression is different. But specifically for those people who keep saying to themselves ""I'm under stress, but that's a small issue compared to the depression."", please just take a moment to consider that maybe if somehow something magical happens that resolves that situation, it might tone down the depression to a manageable level (after a long, long recovery period), even if the stress and depression look unrelated.

For me, my innate response to stress is for all emotions to become muted except dread. I'd call this me being depression-prone. It took me a long time to realize that this is a **completely unconscious** response, even for introspective people, but realizing it has helped me get through periods in my life that were actually secretly worse on my wellbeing than they seemed to me to be.

For those of you who can't see a way out of the stressful situation... All I've got are platitudes, so I won't say them. I just hope that this might lend a little bit of hope if you can manage to find your way out of it, as long as your expectations are set realistically about the recovery time. The recovery time is unexpectedly long.",S
527,"The amount of times I wrote about these emotions is surely some three digit number.. maybe even four.. and I don't know where to start.. and I feel like it won't lead to something new. The discussions are always the same. I can't concentrate anymore because of the constant stress I had for years and this pain in my chest that feels incerdibly unendurable, especially at night. I mean we also let animals or humans die when they are just waiting for death. Why are people mostly biased in favour of physical pain only? Can't they imagine emotional pain that one must keep for life? My first explicit thoughts on suicide developed with 12 and now I am 22 and I am just waiting ever since. I wish I would have done it with atleast 13 or so.. I regret each year. In these years I thought daily ""I wish I was dead already"" with a few exceptions. I wish I wouldn't desire at all anymore because it feels too compulsive. At the same time Idesire to be dead, while I wish I wouldn't have to feel that way. I am drawn from side to side and these inner barriers I constantly have prevent me from attempting to gain a life worth living. People always tell me that I don't try, as if all preventions were only physical or formal. Why do people expect me to live, if I don't have the means to live a life worth living? People always told me it will go, especially when I was younger. I trusted their theories about it just being hormones that go crazy for some years due to still being so young. Whetever they made me believe only caused more pain and suffering. Now I get told it was always my fault or my choice that I am not the way I am. People dislike people who don't work on themselves and what they mean by ""working on themselves"" is more than that in a literal sense, it implies many societal expectations. There isn't even a normal place to discuss suicide with people who aren't already suicidal. Discussion is segregated between groups via exclusion of what most people already agree to. How can one tell me that I am doing wrong when commiting suicide, if I am prevented from justifieing my own views? (Towards those who don't already think so.)",S
528,"So this was 2 years ago, when I was 16 and was going through some bad shit. I wanted to end my life, like really really wanting to do it, unlike those edgy teens who tell people about their “intentions” for attention. 
And so one day, I was home alone, and I had all the means necessary to do it. I live on the 16th floor, there were bottles of toilet cleaning liquid in the bathroom blah blah blah. But then, I thought, “why don’t I try one last time to get someone to listen to me and help me?”. So I went ahead and called the child supporting hotline in my country. That hotline is basically where kids/teens can report their problems if they are being abused and/or are on the brink of suicide, or so my government tells me.I dialed the number, and a lady picked up the phone, saying “Hello, this is the child support hotline, how can I help you”. The lady tone was warm, she sounded like someone who worked in customer care. I felt like I found a bit of hope.
But then reality hit me. As soon as I replied with “Um yeah hello, I am thinking of suicide and I hope you can help me”, she immediately hung up. To this day I still don’t know why she did that. Maybe she thought I was an edgy teen looking for attention (due to my puberty-struck voice) or she was near the end of her shift and didn’t want to work overtime to talk to me. But I’m glad she did, because she made me realize something, something that I’ve been using as a life motto ever since then. And that something is “NOBODY ON THIS PLANET WILL GIVE A FUCKING FUCK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS. EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE “SUPPOSED” TO DO THAT. AND SO ALL YOU CAN DO IS TO SORT THEM OUT YOURSELF, AND DYING ISN’T A SOLUTION.
TLDR: I wanted to commit suicide, called a support hotline and got hung up but after that call I got my life together again.
I hope that my story can help whoever is out there looking for death. Dying isn’t the option. I truly want you to feel better.
Thanks for reading!",S
529,"  I havn't included the other two thirds of the letter as it is way too specific and I believe somebody might be able to realise whos writing it. I want this to be perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have rewritten this letter so many times, trying to make it perfect... I think it’s going to be impossible , but the most important thing is to realise that I do love you regardless of my decision to leave, not you, but the world we live in. I wish there was a still and way to see to you, but there obviously isn’t and I feel that I have no choice but to leave because when I say ‘live’, I’m not really living. I feel like I already died a long time ago and my physical body is just going through the motions of life. I don’t want to ramble on about how shitty things have been because I know you won’t quite get it and quite frankly I don’t want to be that person that whines about nonsense in their goodbye letter. 

But I am sad. I am tired. And I am so lost and out of control. The meds aren’t helping. I don’t think they ever will. I’m trying to make myself better with therapy and while it helps with learning new skills to cope in life, its not enough. I don’t want to just cope and get by. I want to actually be happy, and that is impossible. When I say sad, I mean the kind of sad where I can’t get out of bed, I can’t function like a normal human being, I cry all the time even though I don’t know why but I don’t let anybody see it. It’s the kind of the sad where nothing lights up my world, nothing has since I was 13. I’m empty and soulless and just a nobody. Its exhausting trying to keep up with life. No I don’t need an extra cup of coffee and I don’t need extra sleep. It’s the daily activities that I can’t keep up with, all the smiling and laughing and human interaction. I find myself unable to do normal adult things, like the laundry and keeping my room tidy and even just getting a shower or making a proper meal. I can’t keep up with people’s expectations and be the person people want me to be. And I know it sounds lazy and unsuccessful and whatnot, but please respect this as I have tried so hard for so long to just be normal. I have no goals, and I don’t want to make goals as I’ve always had a feeling I would be gone by the time I was 30 anyway. I know it all probably sounds silly because you guys are all so good at living. 

I don’t want you guys to think I’m selfish for doing this either. I know this is your normal view of suicide but this is not a decision that I have taken lightly and really do not want to hurt anyone at all. I want to you to move on as quickly as you can and live your lives as if nothing happened. I know there may be some moments of sadness or even anger, but please allow yourself to grieve and move on. I’m sorry, I really am, but I need to do this for me. I am not going to last I this world. The way I want to put it, to help you better understand, is to put it in veterinary terms. When an animal is suffering and we have to put it down, it’s for the wellbeing of the animal and generally all other options are exhausted. It’s always for the best so that they don’t suffer through life. I am going to suffer more if I don’t do this. So please let me go knowing it was the right thing, and remember the good times, not the bad ones. Please don’t try to find my body, as I don’t want anybody to go through any trauma from the sight. You don’t need to see me in that moment, you’ve seen me for almost 22 years and have plenty of memories. 

Mum and dad,

Thank you for raising me with morals, taking me on holidays when I was younger, all my dance competitions, for providing a roof over my head and food and for making things fun (where do you think I get my witty sense of humour?). I’m sorry if you feel like I failed you. I’m sorry you had to go through nine months of pregnancy for nothing. I’m sorry it couldn’t be more. We’ve had some amazing times and some not so great times. I’ve said things I shouldn’t have said and you’ve said things you shouldn’t have said. None of that matters. I love you and I always have. I forgive you completely and do not want you blaming yourselves in any way for this. It’s nobody’s fault. It is a well thought out decision made by me. I hope life doesn’t throw any more shit at you than it already has. I know there’s been some really rough times, and I admire your strength everyday and your ability to keep going. Please stay as strong as you always have been. It’s also ok to cry sometimes, but don’t let yourself fall into a deep sadness because of it. Try to see the good in it, and the 22 years that I have stuck around and realise that now it is time for me to go. I want you guys to all stick together and have more family time, because family is precious and I guess life is pretty short isn’t it? I love you so so much. I really really do. Please take care of yourselves.",S

I cant keep up with college anymore even if I do have good grades, don’t know what I want to do with my life, the only positive thing is someone I love but I can’t depend on them to be there for me every second because then it would be selfish. I cant care about myself is what I’ve realized unfortunately.

I ask because I've always told myself I'll do it, but not until my mother and father pass on naturally, and I've made sure my brother is protected (he'll be an adult and get the house). Had this plan for a few years, but a few weeks ago, as the lockdown gets to me, I suddenly felt the urge to rush the plan, as though waiting for my parents wasn't a risk.   


Then I went with plans like dropping an apple from a multi floor parking lot and timing it, driving around and looking for walls or embankments to crash into at 70mph, watching trains from a platform and wondering if I could sit still on the track long enough, facing away from the engine.

542,"I made a promise a few years ago that I would off myself by the age of 30. That means I have about six more years to carry it out and fulfill my own wishes. 

I honest to goodness just do not see a point in staying alive. I mean, why should I? Why shouldn't I just end it all? Oh, because I might hurt those who cArE about me?? Ok. Well I know that everyone is going to forget about me soon enough, so it's really not like it matters. Oh, because I have a future? Well, not really. I completely gave up on college and learning any useful skills that I can maybe apply to my life as a profession. Maybe it is because I am too lazy. 

I think maybe another reason I'm feeling this way is because I'm too scared of life, meaning, I'm too afraid of the future, I'm too afraid of the fact that I'm going to fucking die someday (ironic, I know), and that I'm too afraid of having to go through the pains of life, such as losing those I care about like my mom or dad.

I think about writing extensive letters prior to my death for people I care about and who I know have really cared/do like him. I think about accepting this new job offer and forcing myself to do like 2 shifts and see if it has an impact on my quality of life. I think about forcing myself to go outside and exercise everyday for a week. I think about somehow waiting it out and applying for a special residential treatment program that my psychiatrist would help get me funding for even though it’s out of country. I think about using drugs again, but not as a serious consideration, just the fact that I wonder if it’s better to be a drug abuser than be dead/not exist at all. I think about trying to put more effort into deepening my faith and praying more, speaking to the rabbi more, forcing myself to reach out more even though there seems to be no solutions to any of my shit.

560,"I just had to call 911 to come and get my girlfriend. She took over 4mg of Xanax in an attempt to kill herself about an hour ago. It’s 2am here so no one I know is awake or willing to help so I figured maybe someone would reply here. I haven’t moved since they took her to the hospital. I feel lost, stuck even. Here’s a little back story so you can understand what led to this. 
2 days from today would mark our 5 year anniversary. We are both still considerably young, her 21 and I 22.
We started dating when we were in high school obviously and we moved in together about 4 months ago. It was mostly her choice to move out together so soon, she thought she was ready. Things were going normal for the first 3 months after moving. We still had arguments, as every couple does, but things started to take a turn for the worst. She admitted that she wasn’t feeling happy anymore. After this her entire personality changed. I eventually came to learn that she had started texting an old friend and she had even driven to see him on multiple occasions behind my back. This really wasn’t like her I always thought. We have been together for so long how could she possibly cheat? It’s just not her. She really made me believe that they were just friends and that I was being crazy and had nothing to worry about. I trusted her. 
After she told me she wasn’t happy we had multiple long talks about getting her help and bettering ourselves personally in order to better our relationship. We agreed that she needed to talk to a therapist or some similar type of professional, but she also thought Xanax would make her feel better and forget about her problems. I did not like this idea and tried to put it out of my mind and hers. 
Yesterday while I was at work she was able to acquire at least 10mg of Xanax. Last night she took 2mg and passed out with her phone in her hand, unlocked. Knowing that there was this guy she was talking to and me being the jealous type I decided to look at their conversation. I found that she had been sleeping with him for a couple weeks and all my suspicions were true. I did my best to keep my cool until she was able to wake up and comprehend what was about to happen. 
When she finally woke up I made it clear that I knew what she had been doing. She was still somewhat out of it but she knew what she was doing and saying. She decided she wanted to leave instead of discussing the issue. I watched her get in her car and I watched as she popped another Xanax bar. I ran outside to quickly grab her keys before she could drive away and hurt herself or anyone else on the road. I then just had her parents come pick her up to keep an eye on her while I went to work. 
When I came home from work she managed to drive herself back home from her parents house. She wanted to talk things through, but she was still a little out of it. I could tell she started to think that there was no fixing what she had done and she felt I would never give her another chance to be with me. So she took the rest of the Xanax that she had. I was devastated when she told me this. I told her to throw it up or I would make her but she wouldn’t and she wouldn’t let me help her. I had no other choice but to call for help... as they walked her out she looked me in the eyes... I feel like she hates me now. I haven’t heard anything from her since she got to the hospital, but that may be because of the amount of drugs she took. I’m really worried. All my friends and family say I shouldn’t be... but I just can’t help it I love her 
If anyone read this through, thank you, I’m not a writer
 I Just don’t have anybody to talk to besides her",S
561,"Let me start off by saying i did my best to improve myself and  That wasnt enough for anybody. Atleast i can say i  tried right?

 Everybody hates me , i say this because of how diffrently i am Treated compared to average or hot guys. Here are a list of some shitty things i have to put up with


When i talk to others i get cut off (no im not a long winded speaker) usually the most id say is like 20 words and they dont even take the time to hear that. Instead im just listening to others go on and on for God knows how long while i sit there with my ugly face , looking like a worthless pile of shit and hear them rant endlessly. But since im ugly i geuss im not allowed to speak


When i go out in public i get the mean stare from people , like they cant trust me. I just want to do what i gotta do or get my shit and leave. i didnt come to start trouble but im getting looked at like im some sort of creep in a childrens section


Most people stay as far away from me as possible. I promise im not just pushing others away.


I live my life in fear of what might happen when people see my face. How will they treat me. Will it be worst than last time. My heart rate increases when i step out my house.


Im incredibly short and its like im looking up to everybody. Im like the child of every group. Im a little meaningless spec in the eyes of everybody who knows me. 

Some people only become my """"friend"""" because nobody else wants to take them. If they had it thier way they wouldnt even be talking to me. Theyd be with all the cool fellas. Not some bug eyed , big lip piece of shit like me.

Im being blamed for my problems with dating. Some people may tell me i should hold frame or learn how to speak to girls but MOST GIRLS DONT LET ME TALK TO THEM TO BEGIN WITH. They react as though ive got covid and im coughing on them. They want me faaaaar away. 


PORN ADDICTION!! i watch it even when im Not in the mood. I need relief 


im starting to devlope a food addiction. I discovered that certain foods ECSPECIALLY SWEETS make me feel really happy. I turn to food for comfort. Food gives me the same feeling as when you wake up too early thinking its time for school but you realize its only 4:00 AM and you can gently lay your head back on the pillow and sleep A little more. 


Often times my imagination goes cray. I picture myself with a gf and and friends and im acually likeable. But when i come back to reality everything is pointless again.


False hope!  my brain keeps tricking me into thinking everything is gonna get better and i have a hard time truly accepting the fact that it wont. I just cant believe its gotten to this point.



im 17 , and it already over. Didnt even get a chance. I really want to shoot myself in the head but as of right now , im too scared to do so. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Im about to sleep right now and i hope something kills me. I dont know what , but something.",S

I just never got to experience what everyone else did, and I don't even know if it's my fault or not. I just want someone to hug me at night and be able to tell me that everything's gonna be ok.

I have nothing. I'm too much of a coward to change anything, and I know deep down this is all just my fucking fault for refusing to change and better myself. But other people don't have to try, they just exist and get surrounded by love and attention.

I get told from people that they wish they were me and could just not care about being alone.

No, you don't want to be me, because I never just ""don't care"" about being alone. I fucking hate every single second of it.

564,"I've been on and off Zoloft over the years, recently things have been hard. Sometimes I really wish it was all over. Despite taking the drugs, dealing the side-effects, and going to therapy, I still don't feel that much better.

I've contemplated suicide from time to time, never really gone through with anything because I'm too cowardly, and love my family too much. I still live with my family, attend university, and despite recent events we've done fairly well. Overall, my life is pretty good, so I'm not really sure why I sometimes just want to die. My favorite part of the day is when I finally fall asleep. The peace of nonexistence is blissful.

Sometime though I'm probably going to give in. I stole a gun from my parents, along with some Hydrocodone and Alprazolam and alchohol. I keep them all in my desk drawer, just in case I finally snap and decide to do it. I've researched all the different ways to end it, would prefer nitrogen asphyxiation but don't have any tanks nearby.

I haven't told any of that to my therapist or parents, he would probably report me as a dangerous individual and have my imprisoned in a ward, and my parents would either be disappointed or furious at me. That's the one thing that keeps me stuck here, my love for my family. Sometimes I wish they would push me away, just severe my relationships so it'd be easier to end it all.

The thing that really lingers on me is knowing it may get better, but it will never really be gone. I could be financially successful, have good grades, and loving friends and family, and still feel this way. No amount of drugs or therapy will fix whatever is wrong with my brain.

Guess I just wanted to give a confession, safely to strangers. Don't bother trying to track me down and alerting authorities, I'm using TOR. Whether or not I go, it's my choice. No one should stop me.",S

569,"Faith is a lie. What no one ever prepares you for is to continue to have these thoughts your entire life. 
A job that doesn't care about you, your just another number. Parents who treat you like you don't exist because your thirty five and not married with no kids. A God they tell you exists but you never see my proof.
Yet, they say things like, it will all be okay. It's always someone who's always been okay their entire fucking life that says some shit like this. 
What they don't tell you is: it doesn't get easier. You get older, body parts hurt worse, it's harder to smile because of all the historical events you've lived through and here you all, through all of it, eating one meal a day. Or making sure your dog has food when you don't. 
And who can afford full time therapy? People who make $70k right out of school I guess, huh? Because no one ever died $65k in debt, working a dead end job, that has nothing to do with your degrees. Dreams? What are dreams? Everyone else is living them for me. It was always missing it by one inch, so I quit trying. 
I have been trying to change for 35 years. There's nothing. God doesn't exist. Faith is a joke. I didn't ask to be here. Make sure you tell them the suicide hotline didn't work, neither did the therapy, or the pills. It's all a god damn joke and if there is a God, He's made it blatantly clear He doesn't want me either. So, remember kids, this shit is why Chester and Robin both killed themselves after all those years.

589,"Hi. As I said, she is going through some tough times, and I've been there with her, supporting her through it. Today I found out that she is having suicidal thoughts. She didn't say it directly, but the context was pretty obvious. I talked with her, told her that I care for her, reminded her that she will get through it like she has done before. And she seemed to be doing better at the end.

We both go to the same therapist, and she said that she haven't told her about any of these, and made me promise to not tell the therapist. This is the thing that scares me the most. Although I think she is doing okay right now, I don't know what to do.

If I tell our therapist, she might find out that I broke that promise, and she might not trust me to talk to me the next time she is having these thoughts.

On the other hand, I'm afraid that I'm not capable of getting her through this without my therapist's help.

This situation is emotionally taxing on myself as well. I'm stressed and afraid, something that I usually talk about with my therapist, or ironically the same friend. And I can't do neither.

I have never liked my hair either. When I cut it short I have dips in my hairline where I will eventually go bald. The shape of my head, just doesn’t work well. When I grow it out long I look terrible. My hair curls at the end and dips outward. Almost like this 👩‍🦳 but at ends it shoots out towards my shoulders. It just looks bad and I hate it. 

Body hair on myself I dread, it disgusts me. It makes me want to vomit. It makes me feel ugly. Not sure why I think like that but it’s there. 

My body is weak and useless. I am the definition of skin and bones. Little girls even have more meat on their arms, so I can’t even compare myself to full gown men. My height is about average, but I still feel short. 

Since puberty dick size was always on my mind naturally. I swear I’ve been brainwashed since I was a baby by society into thinking it has something to do with being manly. Anyways long story short I don’t compete at all. Took a huge hit to my confidence especially after 19 when I knew that this was it. All through high school I kept saying soon, soon, soon. I’ll hold off trying to date girls until we are all mature and fully grown so I don’t get bullied. Anyways moving on.

Once I hit 20 started to realize I might be bi. Parents don’t like that of course, not that I get along with them anyways. I don’t even speak to my dad, brother and barely talk to my mom. I never told them that I might be bi since I feel like it could just be a phase. But I heard them talking about that stuff before negativity. I also had some desires to be a femboy, but again it doesn’t really work for me if I’ll look like a ugly guy in a dress. Overall it seems like a lot of family/social drama to even bother with. 

Slowly I started wishing I was a woman. Not really sure why. I think it is an escape, like I’m running away from myself and my problems. I have a bad habit of looking at pictures of women on social media and wishing I had their hair, soft skin, less body hair, lips, their voice, even their body curves are better.

 I forgot to say I hate my voice. I think it sounds so annoying so I don’t talk much at all. Everyone’s thinks I’m creepy or rude at this point because of that. 

Now, my personality is garbage. I’m not the life of the party guy. I wish that I was because at least I have one fucking thing to offer someone. I’ve been pretty lifeless for a good 5 years now. I don’t laugh, I don’t cry, I don’t feel anything but this shitty anxiety, empty, sad feeling in my heart/chest. I’ve seen some dark, disturbing, disgusting things online before and felt nothing, not an ounce of empathy. Lost a couple family members in my life and didn’t feel sad of anything either. So I think I’m pretty dead inside. 

So yeah, that’s my story ish. If there’s anything I learned it’s growing up not having any support, friends, relationships, family  can be will destroy you. It lets you fester these sick thoughts in your head until you destroy yourself from within while everyone doesn’t notice. Don’t be like me. 

I’ve been struggling with how I should kill myself for a good year or two now. I don’t think I’ll do it, but yeah if it does happen it happens, doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things I contribute nothing to anyone anyways. I got into self harm a bit, but thankfully stopped. I’ve decided that if I go through with it I would hang myself at this old bridge over a small river in the rural area where I live. Not much traffic and I don’t want my parents to walk in on my body in my room or some shit like that. I want to put a sign that says coward with white feathers like they did back in WW1 for soldiers who deserted. Idk I think it’s pretty symbolic. I couldn’t fight for what I have so I ran and took the easy way out.",S
634,"I don't understand what went wrong, why couldn't i just be happy like everyone my age. I'm 16, but i'm already so tired of life.

636," So its my first year of highschool and ever since school started I lost motivation to do any of my school work. I used to be a straight A's student in my elementary &amp; middle school years. I just feel burnt out at this point I tried so hard throughout those years to be ""smart."" I was never ""best friends,"" with anyone throughout those year and was basically an outcast within my own group. I was never invited out or even invited to birthday parties or anything. With this new school I'm attending its where all the ""smart,"" people go. I feel so out of place here and my self esteem has just gone down to 0. I'm basically dumb in this school and I barley have made any friends in this school either. I've also cut contact of with people from my old school and that's nice. My mom found about me failing my classes and decided to take my phone away so I could focus on work. Now she's forcing me to attended in person classes. (My school had the option if you wanted to go virtually or in person, I chose virtually) I don't really want to go in person school, I feel like vomiting every time I think about it. I also don't want a repeat of my childhood years in this school. I feel like absolute shit, I'm not smart, pretty, and I'm pretty anti-socail now since covid started. I don't really have anyone to talk to with this so, I thought I post it on reddit.  I've been thinking of suicide from a pretty young age, and sometimes it feels like its my only option.  But I'm scared.",S
637,"I’ve been suicidal for years but I don’t think I’ve ever been as close to actually doing it as I am right now. I feel like the universe has stripped me of every other option and suicide is the only one left. Idk what to do. I have so many hopes and dreams but they seem more and more like they’re never gonna happen and it feels like there’s no real point in sticking around. Life just keeps getting worse...

My life is in absolute shambles. I legitimately don’t have the energy to explain my whole situation right now (u can check my post history if u care for some reason), but it seems like the universe or God or whatever-the-fuck just wants me to die. Like, I’m not supposed to be happy. I’m supposed to fail and kill myself at the end. That’s my destiny/fate. There is no happiness in store for me. I can never win or succeed. I will never amount to anything. I’m supposed to die. The clock is ticking and my time is almost up.",S
638,"sorry if this post is a bit incoherent or weirdly worded. 

 I'm a 20 year old girl, and I have really bad social anxiety and communication problems. tbh I think I might have autism but I'm not sure. I have speech problems and most i of the time i cant maintain simple conversations and sometimes i cant talk at all. I have pretty much no friends and spend all my time on my computer. 

Four years ago I started at a school and met this guy. He seemed really friendly and was very charismatic and outgoing. I slowly developed a crush on him, which I completely ignored because i figured with my problems i would have no chance whatsoever. 

Until about one year ago, when he suddenly asked me out. We started dating, and it all went well for about half a year. he was super sweet and caring. He had some issues with depression and ptsd and stuff, but i didnt mind and tried to support him best i could. Then he randomly broke up with me over text. He told me that he couldnt feel anything at all, he was always numb and he didnt love me, and that he just couldnt handle a relationship with the issues that he had. i was devasted, but told him that i still support him and want to remain friends.

fast forward one month and he tells me that he wants to get back together, on the condition that i get better at communicating. i agree. we get back together and then 3 weeks later he breaks up again. i panic and try to convince him to stay. he tells me that he feels no empathy and that hes always just lying and acting. 

two months later he tells me that he wants to get back together. i know very well that its gonna end bad, but i get back with him anyway because honestly hes my only hope. I feel so awful all the time and hes the only person who makes me happy. and today, while i was supposed to be staying with him for two weeks, and suddenly just told me to pack my stuff to he could drive me home. we talked a bit during the drive and it was relatively calm.

but on the inside all i could think about was how much i wanted to die. I considered it every time he left me. I love him so much and he was the only person i could even somewhat talk to. I have been depressed ever since i was a child and i just cant stand the thought that im gonna have to continue living like that alone. I wasnt happy before i met him, so even if i forget him and move on, im still not going to be happy. I have no one to talk to and even if i did, i probably couldn't. He was my only hope and honestly i just feel so tired and done right now. I know its dumb and pointless but honently im really hoping he comes back again, even if i know he'll just leave again.

sorry this post ended up so long, I've never told anyone about these things before and i just wanted to talk about it.",S

640,"I've never used this subr before, Im really sorry if it goes against guidelines. I read the community rules, assumed it was okay.

I overdosed on ibuprofen. I took 6 800mg tablets

This was about 14 hours ago, I felt fine. I felt fine when I woke up, also. 

It was about 30 minutes ago, I could have sworn I tasted iron in the back of my throat. I don't taste that anymore. I feel a tad lightheaded, I'm unsure if it's due to fear or the meds. I feel a bit of vomit in my throat. Maybe

I don't know what to do. I'm scared my parents will be mad at me for attempting, I wouldn't put that past them. I really don't want to die anymore. I told my girlfriend about it and she started crying out of both fear and happiness that I was still alive. I don't want her to feel the pain of my death.

My biggest fear besides my parents' anger is that I will be sent to a psych ward when I tell the hospital it was intentional. I really REALLY don't want this to happen. I may go to the ER, but how do I get around going to the psych ward? I don't know how I can lie my way around 4,800mg of ibuprofen? 

I'm 16, still a minor. If you're an expert on drugs, please tell me the likeliness that I'll pass from this. Is it okay to stop worrying right now? I'm damned if i go to the hospital, I risk damning those I love if I don't. :(",S

It’ll make it easier to go. I’ll have nobody to stay for. I can always give my puppy away to my boyfriend- someone who will love him. I’m so replaceable. Tiny. Trivial. Irrelevant. This is all I will ever be.",S
643,"God I hate it. It's pathetic, it's shallow, it's horrible and unattractive and everything bad. But I don't think I can live without a girl to love and be loved by. Pretty much my only motivation to do anything actually productive in these past few years as I now realise, has been the hope of having someone to love. The romantic fantasy of someone being there for me, always. Actually truly liking me, truly loving me. And me truly loving them. And I seem to only be able to do it with someone specific. 

My latest ex: Borderline, as fucked up as I am. Told me she just couldn't do it (It being the relationship) right now but she really really likes me and guarenteed me it's not my fault and you know the drill. There's probably some truth to it, but considering it only was a 5 weeks relationship, I doubt that realistically  I should hold out hope...

and yet that hope is the only thing that can get me to do anything productive at all (Been 4 weeks since breakup). If it's practising the piano, getting my psychiatrist appointments or doing paperwork, I all do it with her and the fantasy of what can be in the back of my head. 

And when the reality crashes in that it probably won't happen, that she probably just didn't want to make me feel bad, that I should move on it destroys me all over and I sleep and do nothing until I can convince myself of the fantasy again.
 
It's always been like this and truly, I doubt it can ever not be. Either I finally find someone that won't leave me or I'm doomed to this truly pathetic path of constant despair, which quite frankly might as well be my death sentence as I can't stand it for much longer.",S

And everyone sees it. But no one tries to pick me up. Just wonder why I'm stuck in one place like a lump. Why I'm so dumb and pathetic.

I just don't know how much longer i can take this. I want the pain to end. I hate myself. I'm so disgusted by what I've become. I just want to erase myself from existence. I just wish i could go poof, and never have to think again. Never feel pain again.

680,"One of the things that consistently stops me from completely hashing out suicide plans is the idea of the devastation and destruction it would leave behind, particularly to my aging parents. Where I come from suicide is illegal. You could be tried in court for a botched attempt, and punished if you fail to convince the court-appointed psychiatrist that you are not of a sound mind. On top of this there's the socio-religious element, where a suicide would earn my family unwelcome attention from the wider community, and very likely some degree of condemnation or even ostracisation.  


I can't bear the thought of having them go through all this just because I can't keep my shit together. We have our issues, but I'm not one to forget what they've sacrificed for me.  


I remember watching the very unsettling horror movie Midsommar when it first came out, and being aghast at the murder-suicide scene where the main character's sister poisoned herself and her parents with carbon monoxide, leaving the protagonist to grieve an unimaginable loss.  


When things weren't looking bright, I'd have dark, fleeting thoughts that creep up from time to time. They're not fantasies – far from it – but rather insidious 'what if' scenarios where I find myself in a situation that's desperate enough for a depraved act to take place.  


I'd like to emphasize that these are *fleeting*, or more accurately, *intrusive* thoughts that come without warning, usually when I'm zoning out. I think they're referred to as daymares.  


I'm no stranger to dark thoughts as I've been a depressive for as long as I can remember. But this one stuck. Then one night, the daymares bled into dreams. I woke up drenched in sweat, heart pounding, dreaming I was in a scene not dissimilar from the one in the movie. With shaking hands I immediately reached for a dose of clonazepam.  


When I'm not having these dark intrusive thoughts, sometimes I would think about making compromises. A compromise where I would only catch the bus AFTER my parents die (from natural causes of course).  


TL;DR, is it normal for people to set ""deadlines"" for catching the bus?

SHE SAYS SOME SHIT LIKE ""OH I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE 14! YOU HAVE SO MUCH LIFE TO LIVE""

I DON'T WANT IT

PLEASE GIVE IT TO SOMEONE WHO WANTS IT

THE AMOUNT OF STORIES I READ OF PEOPLE WHO JUST ACCEPT THEY'LL DIE BECAUSE OF SOME DISEASE IS FUCKING HEARTBREAKING 

WHY COULDN'T THEY HAVE MY LIFE

WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE THEM HAVE TO SUFFER AND JUST ACCEPT THEY'LL DIE

I'M SO SICK AND TIRED OF CONSTANTLY FEELING LIKE SHIT

EVERYTHING MAKES ME SO FUCKING SAD OR NUMB

693,"In last couple days I decided life is hard for me and I have tons of problems (with my family, my school, my friends, myself ect) so I want to and my life. I double check every problem and they all unsolvable. No joke answers, no ""go to a therapist"" or ""use anti depressant"" shit. no anything else that not an answer. give me straight answers",S
694,"I have MCAS and suspect I now have pots. 

All of it seems to create massive brain fog, tiredness and over all makes me stressed out. Even stress is a trigger 

My body hair falls out, I have to fast and I’m having so much mental stress over it 

I don’t really think I’m someone who can date either so I’ve been somewhat lonely. I can’t drink, my diet is strict, I’m tired and I get frustrated 

Funny thing is, I’m social and people seem to like me. It’s not so much the loneliness as I enjoy my solitude now. It’s the fact my body is just always breaking down and creating pain for me that translates into mental breakdowns. I love my job and I love my life, I just can’t deal with my body not functioning properly. 

Can anyone here relate? I know our bodies eventually all break down but I feel like from 20 to 34 I’ve been experiencing what most people do later in life. It’s been a very very very long and painful 15 years.

People who disorders or diseases, how do you cope with it? 

I’m afraid mentally the past 15 years I won’t have the fortitude to continue at some point",S
695,"I’ve had a few failed suicide attempts, the main one I tried was suffocation. I would hud my head under my blanket and stop breathing. My heart stopped breathing for a second, then it started beating again. I was to say the least extraordinarily disappointed, so I tried it a few more times, as you can tell since I’m here, none of them ever worked.

I’m just so depressed I feel like I no longer have any will to live. I’ve had such bad trauma in my life that I feel like it’s all my fault at this point. I’m trying to lose weight, I feel as though I’m fat, though I only weigh 80 pounds, but I still feel fat. And I’ve even lost my will power to get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes I get such bad anxiety attacks that I start to hyperventilate, and I feel like if I stop, I’ll die. But sometimes I try to stop, but yet I still can’t. And when I opened up to my friend about everything that happened all she did was laugh, and say, “You deserved it, and I bet you were asking for it anyway.” And laugh again. Then she proceeded to humiliate me.

I no longer want to live. I’ve lost every single one of my friends, and all my family says when I feel bad is “You’re probably just faking it, shut up. If you were serious you probably would be dead already.”",S

697,"I am a failure. I always thought when I reached my age, I would have accomplished more. I was told to get an education and work hard, then I would have a good career, and own a nice house and car. Real life is nothing like that; none of these things have happened. I am stuck in a job which makes me miserable every day and have tried so hard to find something better but was unsuccessful. House prices are through the roof so that only rich people can afford them, and all I will ever be able to afford is a box in some dodgy area.

I have even lost my looks having gained weight at an incredible speed during lockdown. The gyms and everywhere else were closed and I guess I was comfort eating.

Now it's hard to get out of bed. Everything I do is extra effort and nothing brings me joy. What is the point of carrying on when life sucks for most of the population? We live as wage slaves for most of our lives and still aren't able to have assets and afford nice things. Fuck life.",S

 I'm 15M, bisexual and autistic, and my life's a living hell. My parents divorced in 2018, and now not only do i barely see my dad anymore, but my mom's turned into an abusive bitch who always takes her anger out on me. At school i have no irl friends, and everyone bullies me for being autistic. In fact, even a single mention of having friends, a bf or gf on tv can make me feel shitty instantly. I can't even find happiness with my art either; when i try to post it online, it gets like 4 likes and no comments, and it makes me feel like i should just give up.

707,"I feels like at every waking I'm having a panic attack. It's destroying me. For the past year I've had no one to talk with, no real conversations. It seems everything is screaming at me to give up and die, yet at the same time my mind is pleading that it wants to live.

The pain is unbelievable. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm always on the verge of giving up and letting go but I can't, and hate it so much. Even walking down the street it feels like my knees are going to give out at any moment; with me having a break down and crying. 

I've tried therapy, but it only makes me feel lonely. And I can't bring up what I'm going through around any friends; from experience it seems it only causes more problems if I talk about ""problems"". I don't even know if they're my friends anymore. Everyone seems so distanced. Like the people I knew, don't know me; they would walk by me without even batting an eye.

Everything inside of me is telling me to die, I want to so badly, but I can't.",S

709,"I'm 15. My mom's mother was abusive, emotionally. My mom had to endure it for years until a few months ago. My grandma raised me and also abused me emotionally. My mom has a lot of ptsd from mental illnesses as well as the abuse, and sometimes she, i don't even know, like acts a certain way because of it. She emotionally abuses me too, intentional or unintentional i don't know. It's been happening for years, and only gets worse as I get older because in her eyes. I must be independent. I must already know my future, my goals, my aspirations. Everything she had to be, everything she wants, everything she is now is what I need to have. But, there's something wrong in my brain that makes me fall short of her expectations. And i get belittled everyday, manipulated, gaslit, every single day. I'm dumb, i'm fat, i'm stupid, i'm illogical, i'll never get anywhere. She uses my sexual assault as a point in her arguments sometimes. She blames me , that because when i was a child I chose my grandparents over her. and that's why our family is damaged, that's why my step-dad was always mad, thats why everything is wrong. But when I tried to say something, she always sided with them. My grandpa choked me, and I cried and cried and told them. My mom believed me until they got home and my grandpa didn't act mad. so they told me i make myself out to be a victim. and she made me sit next to him during dinner so we could get along. When i was abused by this girl in 6th grade, she said i should have said something or carried myself better. It's always my fault, and I don't fight back or try to. I just endure and agree with what they say even if it's wrong. She says I am like my grandma, the woman who also abused me. She reminds me almost everyday. I am reminded everyday i'll never be good. As if it's a motivation. She says i am not excited about anything so I am lazy. But, i get excited about a lot of things. But they are not related to education, so they are not important. She tells me I should make my own judgement, not too ask questions. But I do the same, then she calls me stupid and to ask questions and not too assume. She sometimes texts me that she doesn't mean it, or writes a paragraph about how she's too hard on me and that she still loves me and i always say she does nothing wrong, because I am too scared to say what she really does to me. My family does not love me as they say I remind them of my grandma. They say it with no guilt or sympathy. They are the forgiving ones, to them they are saints. Today, my friends passed by my house. I wanted to wave to them through my window. But i didn't want to tell my mom, i guess because i didn't expect to have a full conversation with them. So, I asked if I could sit in the sun room. But then my sister copied and followed me, she told me to come back so I said bye. But my sister threw a tantrum which made my mom say I could go back. But then she realized it was my friends and let me hang out. But when I came back after a few hours, she blew up on me that I was manipulating her and that I lied. And that she has no trust in me and I must rebuild it with her. I'm young, i'm 15. But I can't live anymore, I have 3 more years here. And 3 months is already cracking me down to 2 failed attempts. I don't want to destroy my future children. But what if she's right, her words don't motivate me to try harder. They make me become a husk. A husk of fear that I won't go anywhere. Will I even get to have a child?",S

I'm currently 25 as of right now. I grew up in a small town, and I did not have a lot of friends (I have a few though). I always felt like an outcast while I attended school. I have never been on a date (outside of speed dating). I've never been in a relationship. I don't know what love feels like, because I will never experience it. The last time I got kissed was over a decade ago, and it was by my 4th grade teacher (she kissed me on the forehead). I have also been looking for employment in my field of study (which is theatre) for years, but have been unable to get started. Countless applications, interviews, auditions, and lessons have only lead to failures and rejections. It feels like the industry I chose didn't choose me. It just feels like no matter how hard I try or what I do to improve, I will never be good enough or succeed. It feels like I have been rejected too many times by too many people. It's also frustrating &amp; embarrassing to see the friends I do have being in relationships, getting married, having a good career and financially stable, while I have none of these things and chances are that I never will, because life hates me.

The only people who listen are kids and aren't prepared to actually help me(I don't blame them for at all). I hate school I feel so alone and stressed out. And the one thing I was looking forward too got ripped away from me, so now I truly have nothing. I hate myself, my body, and the family I was born into.

Id like to do it with another person, and we would be holding hands. Also, since ive been holding on to this plan for a year, I revised it and added a few details. I would bring a speaker and we would poison ourselves at the beginning of the song ""Human Sadness"" then by the time the song ends, itll start to kick in&lt;3.

So he has his beliefs that prevent him from hoping through with suicide. But recently he told me that he has been avoiding the vaccine because he still wants to die.
He believes that by dying from covid it would not be suicide, it would be leaving it to chance.

I've been repeatedly treated like scum for it, and though I support my opinion still, I just hurt so badly.
I feel betrayed and like a chunk of my life has been cut off.
I already have depression, and got treated like shit recently by a romantic interest merely because I have some female friends.

Im convinced I’ll never be happy because history repeats itself . So yea , I figured I’d do some of the things I’ve been wanting and then DISAPPEAR. Just vanish … like I was never there . 

Y’know … I’ve tried therapy , called the hotlines , spoke to friends, spoke to strangers , spoke to family , spoke to my cat . All this speaking to people and I have yet to receive a piece of advice that makes me hopeful. Why ? Because in the end , it’s all up to me . All . Up . To . Me .

739,"People don't understand that, unless someone, literally anyone cares about you as a child, then it's pretty likely no one will as an adult. No one, especially not my abusive parents, ever cared about me. I've literally never had a single friend, because I already had trauma from my dad when other kids were still learning shapes. 

It kind of permanently breaks something in you. I knew I existed in a different reality from kids pretty early on, because my brain was permanently switched to survival mode just to survive. I mean, I guess I didn't. I have killed off do much of myself just to survive, and I wasn't exactly much of a person to begin with, theres just not much *ME* anymore, anything you could say was me died, it's too late to inform a coroner but maybe we can still have a funeral for whoever I was or might have been, because I'm not them, I'm just a corpse that happens to be wearing their clothes.

I never learned social skills, and I still have difficulty understanding people, and it's too late now. Once you've made it through high school and college without learning social skills, you're fucked. Because now theres no way or reason to even be around other people.

I've never been in a relationship, and at this point in life chances are zero, I haven't even had the opportunity to push people away, no one ever cared in the first place. I literally have trouble with even the concept of support or love because I have not experienced it in any form, and because I never did, I never will.

Turns out being depressed and having PTSD when you're just in middle school makes you kinda a mood killer and not exactly a joy to be around. I am negative vibes personified, and while I can keep up a fascade of normality, theres only so long before people learn I'm just an empty hollow husk of what might have once been a person. My personality is hung like a poster over a crumbled ruin of a wall, it doesn't take much to realize all I really am is a bombed out shell, and any chance I had to be full of warmth and light was many years and many battles now.

I hate myself. every aspect of it. my pathetic body, pathetic mind. i've been writing for about 5-7 years now on one big project, but i now realise how horrible it is. i plan on giving it up, despite it being my dream for however long it's been. every time i begin to type away i just feel more and more empty inside. it doesn't bring me the satisfaction or the joy that i used to feel when i would get a chapter or move on to a different pov.

i can't get any help, whether professional or not. professional is too damn expensive, i can't open up to my family because i'm nothing to them, and i can't burden my friends with more than what they already have. besides, they also keep up a facade of pretending to be friends with me, talking and whispering behind my back but i can still fucking hear them. i'm pathetic. my skinny body not being able to gain anything and my parents will for me to gain weight even if it means forcing me to eat food followed by half an hour of throwing up.

i hate my life and my existence.

I have tried so many anti-depressants to no relief from anxiety, help with depression a little but no anxiety - Benzos are the only thing that provide relief. 

I am beyond tired and weak at this point and want this all over with, even the psychiatrists don't know what to do at this point.

759,"Ways to Die &amp; How

I don’t really want anyone to know. I just want to go on my own accord. There are just so many ways to do it and do it wrong. I’d have to make sure I die, not become a vegetable. I’ve thought of some really good ideas. I’m going to talk to my doctor about getting a DNR. They can’t deny me one. 

1. Gun Range- temple shot 90 degrees
2. Take a bottle of strong pills whatever I can find and down it with a bottle. Go to a hotel in the middle of no where, put the DND sign up with a note: “I’m sorry if you have to clean things like this. Please do not come in without police as you will not be able to forget what you may see. Goodbye. “
3. I was kind of thinking it would be nice to die in a field. Maybe a nice sunset after a nice hike. Nice air. Grass or whatever  Breathing. Just knowing I’ve tried all I can. I’ll give myself one last day. One last good day. I either will take pills that will kill me along with alcohol to make sure it sets in, with no help I will surely pass. Or I shoot myself in the head far enough away from everything so no one would know, hear, or come find me. I just want to feel nothing again. Calm. 
4. I’ve wanted to just crash my car off of the Coronado bridge. The only thing that stops me is if I survive I’ll be handicapped. 
5. An option I think of is to go to some gloomy sea side town. Just breathe and walk for a while. Eat a basic home style meal at some local restaurant. everyone will probably stare. But fuck it. It’s the day. After I might walk some more and back to the hotel or wherever I am staying. Take something I will die from in my sleep. I’ll figure that out later. Just painless and I’ll just go to rest. And I’ll be at peace. Nothingness. 
6. Maybe go on a very long drive. Bring food. Plan my gas stops to limit interaction. Take in the scenes on the way. Smell the salty air.. Find a really good spot to go into in the middle of no where. Along the coast preferably. I prefer somewhere woods like. Maybe a dewy area. Somewhere people would be scared to wander. 


So I guess I don’t have many ideas because I’m not that smart. I can’t think or do much anymore. I guess I’m just living for that last day. I just want that day of nothing and acceptance. I want to go. Whatever happens after death, even if nothing at all. That’s okay. 

If my body is ever found just cremate me. I’ve never had a home.honestly. Just dump them wherever is convenient. A ditch, the trash, down the sink. I just want everything and every part of me gone forever the same way I lived. 

I feel like the insistence on people wanting to kill what they feel inside is only correlated to people who actually do. Some people. Even with a life change, meds, therapy.. are just broken. And I’d rather be gone and not know what happened. I’ve caused so much trauma. So many words I can’t take back that scar the ones I directed them to. 

In a way. I’m hoping someone kills me or I just die of whatever. Someone taking my life would really make me feel at peace. I want to flash back to all the times I hurt everyone I loved and just accept the pain. Let go. Forgive myself and just go. Because alive. I just can’t. And if I get some kind of bad illness I’ll either take my life or ask of an assisted death due to medical condition that is killing me anyways. But if that doesn’t work I don’t care. Writing these words kind of make me think I guess...
Hopefulness. 
That’s maybe what it is. 
Hopeful for that last day. 

At the moment. The only thing keeping me alive is the drive to show Nate the love he deserves, build him back up because I was the reason he broke down, and make sure he loves himself. More than me. And then, when I’m 100% sure he will be okay. That’s when I’ll finally let go of us. It won’t fix the damage I’ve dont to him and the relationship we had. But I’ll know he will be okay. That he can move on with no remorse for my own decisions. What people don’t know, won’t hurt them. I’ll never let him know because I don’t want him to blame himself. But I know I love him. No matter what had happened or will. I want him to feel loved and love himself first. Even alone, he would feel whole. That’s all I’m living for right now. It’s the best reason I’ve had so far.

They know about my depression, but not how bad it is. I don’t have any friends. The ones who claim they are a friend aren’t. Historically friends have come into my life, used me for whatever then checked the fuck out. The person who I thought would’ve been a potential love interest has his heart somewhere else. We’ve been seeing and hanging out together for about 8 months, and I have no idea what is going on. I’m over everything about my pathetic existence.

774,"Im 19 years old.

I flunked out of college last May, where my first semester I spent on campus, though I did everything school-related virtual, and then the Spring semester I did everything from home virtually. I was in a really dark place that May, and I contemplated suicide. I disappointed my mother who’s been the greatest mother for me and my autistic sister. I was closer to her than anyone else my whole life. She was all I had for a good couple of years, and I let her down. I disappointed my father too, but I’ve always been a disappointment to him, and I know I’m not the son he wanted.

This summer I’ve been working a summer job. It’s been alright, but because my parents don’t believe I’m ready to go back to college full time (I can’t blame them, I’d probably think the same thing too), they want me to continue working at this company and then take 2 classes at the same time for this semester.

I’m already a year behind, and my peers are moving on with their lives. But working this job has opened my eyes to the reality of the world, and the reality of how important school is (because of COVID and how everything was virtual the last year of college didn’t “feel real” I guess, I don’t know how else to explain it.) Since this job I have more motivation to work as hard as I can in school, but I know my parents won’t believe me.

I want a life. My entire life really I haven’t had a good social life. Never had a serious, real relationship and that’s something I really want now. But because of my job I’m not gonna have the time or ability to really develop my life. I just want to be normal. Ive fucked up, I know that, but now I wanna try hard to keep up and start to feel proud of myself. 

My suicidal thoughts have been off and on for years, but this time I’m really serious. I have nothing. Now both of my parents don’t believe in me, my friends are moving on from me, and I just wake up, go to work for usually 12 hours, then come home and sleep because manual labor in the hot sun knocks me out.

I feel trapped. I just wanna go to school, full time, in person, and socialize. Meet new people, maybe meet a girl, just feel like I’m normal and happy, truly happy for once.

But with the choices that I made as an absolutely moronic, immature college freshman and the choices of my parents I can’t have that, and by the time I do it’ll be too late.

Imagine the constant need to pee and have been tested for everything under the sun, but with nothing to show for it. Imagine the torture, having no idea when it'll end or if it ever will. I'm in such discomfort to the point I can barely focus on things I enjoy. And that's not the only end I'm frequently going out of either. 

It's been like this for months. MONTHS! Fuck, I just want it to stop. I want to go back to how it used to be, where the only thing I had to worry about was how lonely I was. God, I had it so good then. What I'd give to just have that problem again, to only worry about something so trivial...

I've never really been the religious sort, but this has made me desperate enough to pray. Now, I don't know if this is me reading too much into things or if it actually has any merit, but regardless, it's what's keeping me holding on.

I've been seeing signs. I passed by a shirt that said *brighter days ahead*, came across a plastic glass that read *hang in there*, ran into a card which told me it was *sending positive vibes* and for me to *get well soon*, and a damn video game that I had a random urge to play had a character in the main menu that sang to me and I quote *hold on just a little while longer. Everything will be alright.*

Whether they're signs from a higher power or just happenstance, they're the only reason I still cling to life. I don't want to die. Not if there's a way out...not if  my health improves.

That paper haunts me to this day because I promised myself I’d destroy it when I stop feeling like that. But I never stopped. Not even the days I was feeling significantly better.
Of course, wishing to die is not an actual wish for me. The actual wish is wanting to disappear. More like, wanting this pain to disappear. The result of hopelessness. Like thats the only way to end the pain.

785,"I remember when I was very young - maybe around 8 or 9 there was a big event in my life - which I probably thankfully don't remember. To be honest I do remember but it's hard for me to come to terms with it. I think it was my mom waving a knife at my dad - threateningly. Maybe it was a joke - and to my young mind it was more serious - but I don't think it was. No one waves a knife to their husband and shouts for a joke. I ran upstairs to get my dad something to defend himself - and my dad even said thank you. I remember discussing this at school in around year 2 and me and another kid named nicolhas. Nicolhas told me about his parents doing something similar so I didn't question it anymore. I remember clearly after this my heart just becoming super heavy. I know now it was maybe just light panic or maybe minor depression at that time i just thought it was my heart being ill. I didn't tell anyone. I just felt pretty numb. It continued like this for a long time - I distinctly remember wondering how my heart was still ill.

My mom would always shout at me as a child about why I wasn't happy  like other kids. She once called me the devil's child who cursed her to make her unhappy. It was on the way home from school and my teacher was walking by. This makes me think that my child mind - an especially over active one (who heard almost voices commanding him to go to the bathroom at night) - has exaggerated this else the teacher would have surely intervened. In my memory my mom was calling me the devil (in Chinese so perhaps the teacher wouldn't understand) and how she never wanted me. She would tell me to go die (take into account Asians are considerably more dramatic. There's even a live at the apollo discussing this - sindu vee is the comedian - but this caused me alot of pain as a child) and how I was causing her to have heart attacks and die. She continues this to this day - now 18. I remember that when I cried my parents would take a photo of my face to laugh and show it too me. This is by no means that bad but surely isn't great for a child. 

Idk what I seek from this. Part of me seeks recognition that this was bad - with it so normalised in my life. Its normalised because I know my parents and friends have had it worse - and none had been affected like I have. Part of me seeks answers and comfort. I want recognition I want someone to tear up and tell me this was horrible and its OK that it effects me to this day. I want to not feel so closed up and heavy hearted sometimes.

Finally I know this sort of thing can't be used an excuse. It's a factor but a fact we must get past. Please stay strong those on this sub.

Some days I wish bad things on myself. But I saw a story. 
If you knew someone was going to give you a million dollars tommrow - then you would be pretty happy. You'd be able to get past alot of things in this day - knowing tommrow you'd be getting that million dollars. But if someone offered you a million dollars and you couldn't wake up tommrow - you wouldn't take it. You know waking up tommrow is worth more than that million dollars.

Stay strong everyone and God bless.

793,"first of all, I'm not a native so I can make some mistakes but I really need to venting. I don't want to die but this is the first time my wish about turns into a dust particle.. or vaporizes as water.. or disappears.

I lost all of my trust in humanity. every single person comes to be fake. they only intend to make connections for their interest. partners, friends, academics, relatives.. even mommy too. especially in romantic relations.. I'm such an unsuccessful. I cannot forget my long-term relationship.. he's married now and I realize he just intended to fuck me, he was never loved me. I have difficulty remembered our emotional moments with him but still. I crazily miss him even the past 3 years after we broke (we had been in a relationship for 4 years). For I miss... I am mad at myself. He was the only person, the branch I hold... Then, I liked somebody after 1 year and he's not even accepted my love and rejected me. He's just my academic co-writer and our lab head went away from me even we are close friends. I feel deceived and abandoned.

My friends.. they come to me just want to receive my supportive sentences but not like me much at all. I'm not sure about this part. I don't know how I need and feel taking care of me.. 

Then my family.. I don't like them at all because I don't remember any good memory with my father. I think he has not loved even my mom. When I was a child they were generally fought because my father comes to midnight at home. My mom? I don't remember when she was happy. Last day, I get accepted from a grad school and when I tell her she just said okay and she didn't talk much more to me. I'm not soo successful person but I tried. This is not one of the best schools but this is a highly competitive field for a master's degree. Also, I have had an interest in music, dance, and art throughout my childhood but they never supported me about this. I am angry about them at this point. I saw other children.. their parents buy a piano for them or making supportive connections, and love them but why mine are ignored my successes and only see my failures.. in my graduation, why did my lab head told me ""your parents did not aware of what you did, what your success."" after she met my family. I feel pain. Why nobody hears me? 

Nowadays, I realize nobody wants romantic relationships on the other hand a group of more conservative people married. However, I am okay with the idea of relationships that contains only sex, no emotions, no relationship (I even though I'm hungry for an enveloping love) am okay.. but even this not happening. The people I sex not calling again me.  My dates are canceling last minute even they saw me in photographs. (I don't make photoshop). I a bit fat because I struggle with these situations with the abusing of foods. but I cannot stop myself. (24 yo female, 175 pounds/79 kg - 5'3 - 160 cm.) Why is everything about the only shape? Am I not deserve to love because am I fat. 

I don't smoke, drugs and I try to less alcohol consumption. My sleep is terrible (3 am to 11 am). I often eat much even I'm not hungry when I feel worthless. I was not a bad bachelor student at all but I don't get accepted to a grad school because of my GRE scores (except one). I take a high point of science exam point but a low interview point. Because of lack of a grad degree, I cannot work in my field and I'm still living with my parents for this economics situation. I want to change in a positive way... I want to improve myself but even these are fixed, is this makes people fake? For example, If I lose pounds and someone loved me, is this deceitful? Why people cannot love me just because of who I am. I wish I could disappear. I am a lost traveler in this way. What can I do I don't know. Thank you for your listening.",S
794,"Maybe not now, or for the next few years, but when I'll know that I can leave my friends and they will be fine is when I will do it. Until then I might change my mind or find a way to do it, or maybe my friends will leave me and I will do it sooner. But I am afraid that if I will change my mind or I'll just not be able to leave my friends than what am I supposed to do? I hate school so fucking much and I don't care about it cause I'm gonna kill myself anyway, I can't believe my future is depends on that fucking shit. I always knew I wanted to be some kind of programer or something like that, but now that I'm suicidal, even though I know that I will probably need to be it fo income I just can't, I just don't want to and I can't describe this feeling, maybe it's because deep down I know I will kill myself so why should I care about my future. I already fucked up the last year of middle school because that's when I started feeling really suicidal and I thought I would kill myself before highschool but I didn't and I don't want that to happen again.

Also please don't tell me that I'm young and that I have time or some shit like that, it's really invalidating my feelings in my opinion.",S
795,"I’m a 23 year old male college student about to graduate with a bachelors degree. I have had an awesome life so far but I’ve had suicidal thoughts since like 11-12. There’s been times when I’ve definitely not had them but it always comes back. I lost a good 111 pounds from like 2019-2020 and that helped a lot but I’m still not where I wanna be. I used to talk to friends about it and try to get their help but that usually only ended up hurting those friendships. So I’ve dealt with it completely alone for a long time now. I’ve told  my parents twice through two different schools. Once at 11 and again at 17, but not much ever really changed. My parents truly care about me, as I’m an only child and my parents tried for many years to finally have a kid. I think some of this might run in the family because my mom has been on antidepressants for 20+ years and tried to kill herself at like 16 and I’ve had some relatives commit suicide. I think my biggest issues are is I have no ambition and I’m afraid of change. I feel so fearful and stressed, but despite at times overcoming this it usually doesn’t change the fact I don’t feel happy and nothing seems like it’s worth it at all. Why should I try my hardest to build a life when it won’t make me happy? I know life will only get harder and I’m like this at some of the easiest parts of my life. I think the best way I can describe and make sense of what I’m trying to say is that I feel I’ll never be happy so what’s the point building a life when I know it’s not worth it? I’m a religious person so I’ve tried to interpret this through Christianity but the best I’ve been able to do is ask God to just let me die. Sorry if this seems incoherent or rambling but I’m not sure how to put some of these feelings into words. But I just wanna talk to someone about this for once.",S

I was pretty satisfied with myself and I wasn't pressured or anything like that. 

However, reality hit me like a bus. I didn't get into my dream university and I failed every scholarship I applied for. I watched my friends and former classmates pass the exams and a lot of them got what I had failed to achieve. 

Now I feel like I'm at rock bottom. I don't know what to do. The last scholarship that applied for announced the results today and I didn't make it. My life basically revolves around whether or not I have an outstanding academic background and now, I feel like a failure.

Instead of feeling happy, everywhere I go, I feel lonely, depressed, and anxious. I’m in a small Midwestern town with no possibilities for joining clubs or making friends, really. I only have one friend but I feel that my friendship isn’t as strong as it once was due to us going different paths. Every day my chest physically hurts from the pain of having no real friends, no boyfriend (I’m a gay male), and no family support anymore. 

There is no purpose for me to be alive. Nobody cares about the things I do, and quite frankly, I see myself as an awkward burden on society as a whole— my interests in philosophy, languages, etc, aren’t “marketable”. I want to be a professor, but even then, I still feel like I’m going to end up forever alone.",S

805, I have attempted pretty much every way off killing myself you can think off except shoot and set fire. I've even had police and doctors and paramedics day to me they don't understand how I'm still here because what I do with no support network and no one looking out for me at all and the several of what I've done that would have killed someone ages ago. I'm still not going to give up trying though. Surely my immortality  can't last forever. I need to die. No one will notice me gone. I'm treated like I already don't exist. I've already been told by police and paramedics in past that I'd be left rotting undiscovered in the flat whatever happens because no one cares enough to check on me or anything. Even the police won't put me on their too watch list to do regular checks on as rutine because they say it ain't their job but yet do it for others who have support networks and aren't as high risk. Compulsive lying hypocrits. I don't want to satisfy them by killing myself but it will satisfy me because then I know I won't have to put up with the ignorance and neglect anymore where as those wasters will have to carry on putting up with whatever bs gets put apon them the test off their corrupt narcissistic lives.,S

811,"Hello. I'm writing this post with the unique aim of externalizing, perhaps, the most annoying affair not only I, but my family are dealing with. I do think very often in harming myself. Since I was barely a teenager it was a common thought when facing abandonment. Almost obliviously and uncontrollably thoughts of this sort showed up in my mind. At present I believe that at the beginning it was but a culpability management strategy I had. At times I scratched my arms skin till bleeding when feeling guilty. However, nobody noticed that and I didn't pay more attention to that occurences. But it wasn't till 3 years ago when this kind of ideas began to ocupy my mind with an overwhelming frecuency and intensity. By that time I had gone through anxiety and depression some years ago yet I had overcame them in his complete breadth without self-harming. Breaking up with my first partner might be the triggering of this episode that nowadays does go on. They were not only a few times when I eroded my own skin with some sharp objects. Throughout the last months that ideation and acting-outs worsened fatally. After having been rejected by a special ""friend"" I went through three episodes of self-harming by taking an overdose of pills. With impulsivity I took an overdose of clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant whose overdose can easily result in death. Even so, I persevered with my destructive behavior and abused of benzodiacepines twice which also resulted in gastric lavage. I needed three hospitalizations to help me to ""hold"" or ""contain"" this impulsive behaviors and settle an accurate diagnosis. I was derivated to the personality disorder unity of the psychiatric hospital with the suspicion of the possibility of BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). Consequently, I received an evaluation by psychiatry and clinical psychology. The diagnosis: Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive personality traits. Whether psychiatrist or psychologist, they made to their minds that the origin of my self destructive behaviour is not in my personality. Then, I was recommended to attend therapy. Last months seem to have been taken from a nightmare. I cannot quit thinking in the suffering this has caused to my family as I saw them whilst all this stuff went on. According to the psychiatrists and psychologits I have talked with during my hospitalizations, their advise is that I must work on abandonment, frustration and failure tolerance management. Now, thanks to medication I feel with more capacity of having under control myself and the suicide behaviours have decreased. Time to time I even have self-harming thoughts when recalling what happened with those relationships which ended. I would like to hear your voice and feel a bit understood by someone. For that, I'm redacting this post. It would be a pleasure to exchange experiences related to suicide ideation and attempts with you. Let me know.",S
812,"I’ve lost virtually everything I care about. All I have left is a family that barely understands me. They try, which is more than they used to, but it doesn’t help much. I loved my friend and deluded myself into believing a friendship was equivalent to a romantic relationship. for no other reason than for that I was head over heels, I got accused of being a manipulative sociopath by the person I love, who got me through the darkest time of my life. Or that’s what I think I’m being accused of. That’s what others think I am, at least, but I haven’t spoken to the guy I love since this happened, a person who I loved for five years and sacrificed immense amounts of my time to try and help. It’s not that he didn’t help me, he did even more than I helped him, but it just feels so disappointing and profoundly nihilistic that five years of love and a year of complete dedication lead to my life being destroyed. I’m not the nice guy type who thinks that I should get romantic fulfillment from this, but I just can’t believe that he would believe that I want to hurt him. That’s the only thing I get angry about. The fact that he could honestly, so quickly come to believe that I had been intentionally manipulating him for so long. I was a lost person, in a deep depressive episode, and in that episode I lost the greatest thing I’d ever had. And now as a result of this spreading, I’ve lost all my friends; every action of mine is analyzed until the worst possible motive can be found, and as a result, things I tried to do right only turned people against me. Friends I’ve had for years believe I’m a psychopath. And nobody ever thought to question it, at least that I know of. The vast majority never spoke a word to me before making a decision. Now I have to completely uproot my life, and live knowing that everyone, most of all the person I love beyond rational reason, is happy seeing me leave and move away, and they all think I deserve it. The guy I love got involved like this once before with someone, a similar thing happened, and that person kept her friends, that person still talks to him. I don’t know if it’s homophobia related cause I’m also a guy, or if it’s something else, but somehow my similar situation turned out so differently. I’m so lost now, I just spend all day regretting and imagining. Every single thought I have involves him or this whole situation in some way, and I not only can’t find joy in anything, but actively find pain in almost everything I do. There are numerous hobbies I’ve had to drop, games I can no longer play, because they remind me to much of this person. I thought I was in hell before, but it’s so much worse now. I don’t know how it’s going to get better. I know I probably have a bright future. I’ve told my therapist all this. But everyone has told me I just have to bear the pain until it gets better, that there’s nothing that can be done right now, and it just feels so unfair. More than that , I don’t even know if I can get through it. I’m not suicidal now, I don’t think I could do it to my family, but then again, I have been in the past, so who fucking knows. I just don’t know what to do. I have to solve this situation somehow, to at least come out of it in a way that isn’t hellish for for me, but I have no idea how.

It’s been a culmination of things. The first anniversary of my mother’s death is coming, I hate my job and today was a rough day, my sister continuously blew up on me, and in general, I’ve been really depressed the last few weeks. I wish I weren’t here, y’know? Alive, I guess. Sometimes, it doesn’t really feel like living. I’ve slowly cut off the few friends that I do have, in the off chance I may actually go through with everything, I don’t want them to be affected. My sister and I have a rocky relationship.

It started okay but as the day continued, I let her get to me and ruin it. Now today is like all the others. Over the last few years, I’ve gotten really good at hiding my emotions. It’s easiest to hide my anger and act like its fine because it’s not socially acceptable to constantly lash out of rage. Most of the time, my family can’t really tell how I feel, so they assume I’m fine. My family knows I’ve always struggled with mental health, but never truly to what extent. In one month, I’ll be completely finished paying off school debt I’ve incurred. I have no car payment and our lease ends in September. I had a will drawn up a few weeks after my mom passed away, the only beneficiaries are my sister, my aunt and my two female cousins. I think it’s time for me to let go.

The thing is I was doing so good these past months. About 4 months ago I was suicidal. I kept thinking everyday I wanted to just end it. I hurt myself and I hated waking up. After that I got better, more social, happy. 

I finally gathered the courage to see a psychologist about a traumatic event and now I’m going to report her and hope they at least fking fire her but i know they won’t. The only thing that’s gonna happen is them talking to her and saying that’s bad.

I appreciate everything you've given me. I don't blame you for this. Even if you were at fault, there would be no point in blaming you. That's just how things happened.

I'm planning to go soon. I'll probably wont, because I plan it everyday, but there are still things that need to be done.

Please keep people around me safe and happy. If they did care, make it painless. Or atleast the grief period short. Don't let them blame themselves. It's my choice to not get better.

I'm sorry everyone.",S

845,"Once, i was happy young man. I was looking for a present for my girlfriend. She was having birthday in a week. While I was looking through some things, my phone started ringing. Grandfather of my girlfriend told me, that she died in a car accident along with my best friend (her sister). After that, everything changed. I didn't know what to do with my life. I was completely lost in it. I tried to kill myself. I tried to hang myself up. But in the middle of nowhere in a forest, at the very last minute someone showed up and saved me. The doctor said that if he would have come minute later, i would have died. Even if I am not proud of it, i cut myslef. Because the physical pain was way better then the thoughts and memories. Everyone was just telling me, that I am just an attention seeker.

Well. It was two years ago and I am still one broken guy. Still don't know what to do with myself and how to live alone.",S

I tried and succeeded in most things, somehow I just feel helpless and dead inside. My parents don't love me, I can't get my relationship straight, I feel alone around friends. It is not the first time I have felt suicidal. I feel it every time my mother shows me how lowly I am. I have an itch to just jump off and onto my head for 100% chance of death so that it is neat.

856,,
857,"It is a weird debate I am having with myself these days. I honestly love my family and friends, and don't want to ruin two days a year for them for the next few years. Ruin may be a bit exaggerated, but it comes down to them being reminded I stepped away from life. I don't want my beloved ones to think about my death on both my birthday and the day of my death. 

Stupid thing is a reason I would go is that I can't connect to people anymore. I can't believe they honestly like me. I can't believe they are not forced to talk to and chill every so often with me. I can't believe they are genuinely as lovely and caring people as they are. However, another feeling I have is that I should do the deed when it is my birthday to not make any beloved one sad on two days a year instead of one. I am deeply afraid, and rationally speaking do think, they genuinely like me and would be sad if I'm gone but can't help the feeling it is all a lie.

On my birthday, it is the 25th here atm and I attended another trip around the sun on the 29th, I could be gone. If I am not, I am afraid for what the future will bring me. Stepping away another day than my birthday feels wrong and I do not like the assumption I will have to get through another year. 

I wish I could donate the life I have to someone who would enjoy it. Sports going great, school going fantastic, plenty of friends. The minor problems are a PTSD and social insecurity. Fucking hell I can't believe I may actually kill myself over these things. I don't deserve to have these thoughts. I followed all stupid rules. Maybe because I can only and will go down from this point. I don't enjoy being at the top of shit anymore, I just don't want to step down on grades or performance because when I do, many will be proud about themselves for ""beating"" me in a game that actually doesn't know winners and many will talk about my fall. 

I wonder where I was going to with writing this text. Just like the écriture automatique that stems from the beginning of the 20th century I didn't care what I wrote down nor corrected any sentence. 
I hope I followed guidelines, please remove my post if I messed up. I don't care about where this post ends and definitely don't care about the amount of attention I get (I'd actually getting no attention at all I think, it's hard to explain why I finish my texts when writing here but don't finish them while alone). I calmed down from writing and think I'll be ready to log out of this account for sometime until I feel the need to write on something I can't throw in the trashcan after two sentences or permanently if I decide to go. 

I feel so sorry for bugging you if you've read this whole thing. The attention deserves to go to those who have actual terrible lives and valid reasons. Over the course of the last weeks I wrote several posts like this but didn't actually place them. I feel like I want to document this one because of the amount of random stuff I put in it.",S

867,"not too long ago, maybe a few months back i made a stupid decision and i took 25x100mg of zoloft. it was an awful fucking night and so painful. 

i was so weak and extremely shaky all over for days afterwards, it was scary. but no one knew what happened and i covered it really well. i barely even had the strength in my legs to walk up the stairs in my house without my legs shaking so bad i thought they were gonna give out. 

i felt so dumb. SO dumb. i only told my one friend about it while it was happening but he didn’t really care too much because we’d had a conversation about this a while back and he said you won’t die taking a bunch of these. i guess it was just wishful thinking that if i took all of what i had which was 25x my dose i might have had some luck. i just felt so stupid after i told him and i never want to tell anyone about this ever again 

i just wanted to get this off my chest. i’m 21 now but i still live with my parents and they don’t know about the extent of my mental health issues which is how i plan to keep it.. it’s just so scary being alone through all this sometimes 

im not on medication anymore, but i have a mix of over 60 lexapro and zoloft pills and even after my last experience i still find myself holding them sometimes. i just have to try and tell myself it’s not worth trying again.

I was screwed over and been angry ever since. 2 months later forced to move from a big peaceful home to a nightmare. Haven’t sleep since. My days and potential have been wasted. Arguing with my mother nonstop, every aspect of my life controlled. Huge rise in mental stress as a result and health declined. Woke up one day with severe anxiety attack not knowing what it was and couldn’t breathe. Have had disastrous physical symptoms ever since. Following this I broke up with someone I loved in 2020 after 6-7 years because because they couldn’t understand what was happening to me or believe me. One year later I’m still in the same place, woke up with severe anxiety attack again, nightmares of my ex, chronic exhaustion, deep depression and confusion, no sense of self/worst social anxiety. I’m nowhere where I want to be in life. I feel like I’m in Jail 24/7. Everything I believed I could be is being thrown out the window.

I'm going to take the rest of my pills, along with a bottle of pain meds, and maybe some alcohol to seal the deal. Whatever I have. I don't care if it's painful. I'm also gonna sneak out into the woods so nobody would find me if they wanted to. Maybe my corpse will bring a bear joy.

871,"I've struggled with depression and suicide for most of my life. I'm 27 now. I've been in therapy, and for several years with more than one therapist. I go every week. I take the medication. That's what makes this all the more real for me - despite all of that, I feel deep in my bones that taking my own life is the best course of action for me. I don't want to get into the specifics with strangers on a public forum, but my life has been complicated. I had a really fucked up family situation growing up, and I've had a weird relationship with myself and my identity as an individual for as long as I can remember. I struggle with anxiety and severe depression at the bare minimum, and with extreme mood swings and obsessive thoughts on the worst days.

The last year and a half of my life has been full of crazy ups and downs. I moved across the country for ""my dream job"" in 2019, and rekindled a really important relationship in my life. Shit was great, for the first time in like 7 years, for the second half of 2019 and the first few months of 2020. Then obviously things changed, and all of the stuff I had been working towards fell through. The startup I was working for started to struggle, the isolation ad quarantine and just sheer insanity of the political landscape in the US took a big toll on my relationship (I needed to disengage and have my space away from the insanity and news cycle, she wanted to battle about everything). By like October 2020 I was stuck in a really dark place emotionally, far from family and in a really unhealthy relationship with both work and my SO. My mental health was affecting my work, and I lost one job in December, another in March 2021. I re-located home to be near family, even though my family is just as problematic for me as any of the other stuff was. At least they were people to be around, or something. But my parents are angry and aging and don't know how they fit into a modern world, have no meaningful advice to give me, and the savings I have been living on since March are running out.

I look at the united states (really, the world, but I'm in the US so that is what my immediate ""world"" looks like), the way things are going, changing trends and the available jobs in my industry, and I just see such a bleak picture of what is to come. I can barely function even with all this time off to focus on self care and personal growth, I wake up each day more depressed than the last, and over the last 2 or 3 weeks I've been building a plan for suicide. It started as a mental trick to get through a really depressed day, but now I have canisters of helium in the mail and a couple notes to different people written. It's all ""just in case"", and it's not like I have a date and time in mind, but the progression from ""I really could if I needed to"" to ""Here's the stuff, just need a time and place"" is scary.  


I honestly don't know what I'm going to do yet, but this is the most depressed I've been in like a decade, and this is the most effort I've ever put into a plan for self harm. It's kind of empowering in a really fucked up way, but like I know that the few people left in my life don't want me to do it. And a part of me is mad at them for thinking they know anything about me or my situation and what is best, and I think its selfish of them to ask me to go through years of pain just so they don't have to... but I also recognize that a lot of that is probably the depression speaking for me.  


Honestly I'm not really sure why I posted here. I lurk, but I've never wanted to post because I think people probably just think I'm being dramatic or that my problems aren't real problems. Maybe that's true. I just needed to get some shit off my chest, maybe. Thanks for listening.",S

880,"I was gonna post this on r/schizophrenia but it’s private now for some reason. So I’m diagnosed with that, but I feel like it’s just inaccurate. I feel like all my symptoms match borderline personality and bipolar way more.

I have very unstable moods, where little things can make my whole mood change out of nowhere. I go through periods of motivation followed by intense depression. I have very low self esteem, and the reason I got diagnosed with schizophrenia was delusions. 

I’m not sure if a diagnosis change even matters but I don’t like my current psychiatrist as they don’t seem super educated and our meetings last legit 2 minutes. Im currently on Latuda(antipsychotic) and Wellbutrin(antidepressant) which I guess would be okay for any of those diagnosis. Is it even worth trying to change my diagnosis?

But yeah since this is suicidewatch I’ll just add that I’m in one of those bad spells right now. I believe my dad caused me to feel invalidated as he would always point out the flaws in me as a kid and I caught him doing it today (I’m 21) and I called him out on that shit, I’m glad that I stood up for myself but I still know he’s never going to change. He’s doing it because I bet he’s insecure too, which brings me to my next point… fuck parents not sorting their shit out before having kids.

“Hey op, it’s drunk op here. I’ve just got a question for you. Why are you still trying? And when I ask that I mean at everything. You’re a shitty teacher. You can’t keep a relationship for more than a year. You are a horrible son, brother, uncle, and grandson. Your friends would do better without you bringing the mood down. You will curse every endeavor you go through just by being you. And help refuses to come your way. No matter how hard you look or try. So please, do yourself and myself a favor. Find it in you guys to overcome your Thanataphobia, take “The Claw” (that’s what I call be personal pocket knife), and drive it into your heart! You’ll feel much better! Please, stop trying to pretend you’re okay. You aren’t. You’re pathetic and alone. Just do the manly thing. Admit defeat, and die.”

i have not been this depressed in about a decade, past traumas are beating my ass and my everyday life is just a super pathetic and draining cycle.
i’m just so fucking tired and everything i do feels as if it’s in vain. being tolerated at a shitty job i fucking hate and i can barely save up or afford shit. only being able to afford one class per semester.. i am never going to graduate, and would be stuck in this stupid
cycle for years..
my family wants me to fucking pray this all away and won’t listen to me, i’m slowly dwindling away from all of my friends because i’m sure they’re just tired of me, the person i’m in love with does not love me back and only sees me as an sexual object...yet i still love and do fucking everything in my power to support and please these people to no fucking avail... i have no current support or grip and it’s fucking embarrassing. every aspect of my life is beyond fucking embarrassing and painful. there’s no way i can keep on facing it for another 40+ years when i know there’s worse suffering to come.
 i tried so fucking hard to keep it together and wait until my parents pass to actually do this, but i just can’t anymore. i can’t wake up screaming anymore because i’m still here, i can’t fake a personality anymore, i can’t tell compartmentalize anymore. i can’t stay alive to keep other people from falling apart anymore.

i’m waiting to pick up, and i just can’t wait to take them and get some fucking rest. i think i deserve it.",S

I don't know why but the feeling of vomiting like that is so amazing to me because it smells and taste so strongly that I'm not able to think for a few minutes, its like the vomit takes all my energy and i just lay there for a bit. i know this isn't directly related to suicide and might be more so addiction but i think part of the i like it so much is because it gives me the feeling of being close to death but still being alive. Ive had pretty bad depression for like 4 years and I'm still pretty young so i feel like my life isn't gonna get any better because in the past 4 years it hasn't. i don't plan on trying to OD again for a few weeks so idek why I'm sharing this but i tried searching up anything about vomiting after ODing and all i could find was medical, so i just wanted to talk about how amazing and awful it is.

Her state isn't good, it's left her with little to no memory and myself with many horrible ones. I was 23 when my family(my two siblings, father, and myself) all agreed on the decision to push forward with everything we had for my mom instead of taking her off life support. Today, I am the only one who's life has really been affected by it. I don't know if things will ever be okay with what I've experienced and more and more I feel as if they never will be. I have become resentful to my family, all but my mom for it was never her choice and she can't help herself. I've tried talking to them about my struggles but I'm just told to find another job and get out of the situation.

I feel so behind at 30 as a college drop out and being crippled by student loans. I'm looking at minimum wage jobs listed online and wondering how I'm supposed to just move on and struggle in some dead end paths for the rest of my life with this world of pain in my head. I feel like I've lost the best years of my life and I feel like I can never have a family of my own which is all I've ever wanted. I have nothing in this world.

You said no let’s go to the drive in that’s 40 mins away  . Carefully picked out a handful of candy that I thought you would enjoy . I was so disappointed because I know that you promised to take me on a date finally.  I asked you a couple months back to take me to a pumpkin patch you promise but never delivered . And here we are Halloween doing  the only thing we would do that was semi-normal . A drive in ….. Usually you would ask me to perform some sort of sexual act  on you or you would piss in a cup and surprise me ( with out  consent ) . Or you would punch me across my face as a treat (without consent ) you said you liked the Element of surprise. When I got there you were already annoyed 😒you didn’t want my candy … we got in a fight about some thing and you got out of the car and slammed my door and called me a bitch  . God I wish I would’ve drove off I wish I would’ve left you there I wish that’s when I gave up on you , but it wasn’t . You asked me to go to the strip club . I was so annoyed I had to drive all the way to Another location . We got inside and you ignored me and started talking to this girl . I just allowed you to talk and I didn’t even look over try to flirt with you or try to get your attention I was just over it , you enjoyed showing the strippers all the things you would do to me the videos / photos . I Remember this certain girl on stage and I remember just telling her that I thought she was beautiful over and over as I sat next to the stage because I really wanted to hear that from you and I wondered if that’s what she wanted to hear from other people as well and I didn’t want her to feel like an object like I felt like a object . You asked me to take a drive with you . You took me to the back alleyway and fucked me with my ass hanging out of your car in a middle of A dirty street and had me suck your dick … I remember as you were having sex with me I looked up and I seen the biggest moon 🌝. I Just focused on that moon at that moment I knew it was over I just had to get the courage to let you go you were talking about the stripper as you screwed me I felt sick to my stomach . I just kept thinking about the pumpkin patch and how I really wanted to go to an apple orchard and how fall would  be magical to have a boyfriend , but yet here I was with you my “Owner/ “boyfriend” , “ Being downgraded and fucked . The you simply drove me to my car cause you couldn’t finish because there was homeless traffic near by , you drop me off in the dingy parking lot of the strip club and drove off didn’t even see if I got my car safe . That’s what gave me the courage to leave you .  I  got in my car and I kept it unlocked because I even kind of wish someone would kill me in that parking lot or Hurt me . I know that’s dark to think that’s where I was that mentally . That if I was to die that night I wouldn’t of cared . I was completely gone , there was a shell that’s it . After about 30 minutes I finally drove off . That is the night I decided I was going to leave you .",S

Sitting here, on my bed, guitar in hand, singing a bit, writing a bit, it's all i can really do right now while on so many meds.

Thinking of killing myself, but differently that usual. Usually it's a wish for death, i feel like i want it more than usual, instead of hoping i die in my sleep, i have this drive to do it, to make it happen. 

I feel angry, i want to burst. I feel like I'm on the edge of just cutting my face apart with my hunting knife. I want to hurt, bad, i have this urge to badly injure myself. Something inside me wants to send me to the hospital. I'm driven towards killing myself, everytime, everywhere, the feeling i have to jump in front of a truck, the urge to just pulled the wheel and crash into the barriers, i want to scream FUCK, i want to scream, i want to scream, i want to tear my skin open, like hurting myself is the only way to come back to my senses.

The end of the year is tough, the last 3 months mark many failed suicide attempts. i hate Christmas, it marks neglect, screaming at my family i want to hang myself and being told to stop being such a crybaby. Only my oldest sister cared, and I'll never forget that. I've been told many times, in an annoyed manner, ""can you stop being so sad all the time?"", It's all i feel, I'm in pain, I'm suffering, they want me to stay alive but get upset at me when I'm sad. FUCK YOU. 

It's becoming hard to remember basic stuff, i assume due to lack of sleep, but i don't know, it's frustrating sometimes, most times i laugh it off and try to forget about it. 


It's hard, to resist the urge to just delete everything I've written, delete every contact on my phone, and just go into the bathroom and kill myself. Though this counter-urge of necessity of clarity for my loved one/s kind of balances it out in my head, but it just feels so unstable, like I'm walking on a rope over a giant canyon with fluctuating counterweights.

It's hard to tell if everything I'm writing is heartfelt clarification for my loved one/s, or if it's all just mindless rambling to the outside world. I can't tell if anything i say means anything anymore, at least i can't ever be sure of it.

952,"I (27m) have suffered from physical health problems for the past decade. They won’t kill me, but they do make my life miserable. I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying every treatment possible (both legal and on the black market) to no avail. I am clearly stuck like this forever, and due to ageing things will only get worse with time. I am unwilling to go the rest of my natural life with these problems. My quality of life is too low to enjoy being alive. I have decided I will kill myself. I have the method (can’t say what it is, but it’s not survivable), the suicide note, and the will ready. I don’t want to die, but dying is preferable to a long unhappy life. I am planning on doing it in about two weeks, give or take a few days. I wish I could go on living for her sake, but I am suffering beyond what a normal person could tolerate, and it is having a disastrous effect on me. Continuing to live with these symptoms is not an option.

My fiancé (28f) has had depression and schizophrenia since her late teens. We have both made suicide attempts in the past (mine failed due to poor execution), and we have agreed (at her suggestion) that neither one of us is to attempt suicide without the other.

We are very close. Other than when I go to work, we spend 100% of our time together (we even go to the bathroom together). I am posting this while I am at work, in between texting her. We are total loners, and our only social lives are with each other. Neither of us has difficulty socialising, we just complete each other so well that we had no need for anyone else when we moved in together. We have lost contact with our friends and families for this reason, and we have no desire to be in contact with them anyway. As much as I love her, I do think she loves me more, as she is much more clingy than me and regularly demands more attention than what I have given her.

I have reminded her hundreds if not thousands of times that if I cannot get my health sorted I will be killing myself, and she says she would want to join me. I have now told her that my health cannot be fixed, so I might kill myself soon and she says she still wants to do it with me.

It’s a shame, because if it wasn’t for my physical health we could both be living happy lives with optimistic futures ahead of us, but that’s unfortunately not how things have worked out.

Although I believe she would want to commit suicide with me, I doubt whether she would be able to go ahead with it. It’s very easy to accept your own mortality until you are at death’s door. This leaves me with three choices:

1: I kill myself without telling her
Pros:
-she may not commit suicide if I am not around to assist her. I want what’s best for her, and if she can be happy without me, I’d prefer that
-she may find someone else (this makes me feel sick to think about, but she’s a very sweet woman and she would make a wonderful wife and an even better mother)
-she doesn’t get traumatised by thinking she could have saved me
Cons:
-I feel like I have let her down. Betrayed her, even
-she never gets a chance to say goodbye
-she doesn’t get closure
-she may kill herself anyway, without the benefits of us doing it together


2: I tell her I am going to kill myself, but I do NOT allow her to join me, even if she wants to. I then commit suicide alone
Pros:
-she gets a chance to say goodbye
-she gets closure
-she may not kill herself if I am not around to assist her
Cons:
-it may be harder for her to move on and find someone else than if I had done it without telling her
-she may feel like she has let me down
-she may feel like she could have saved me, and have survivor guilt
-she may kill herself anyway, without the benefits of us doing it together
-she may talk me out of it, forcing me to kill myself at a later date without telling her


3: I tell her I am going to kill myself, and allow her to join me if she wishes to do so
Pros (assuming she joins me):
-i die next to my soulmate
-we never spend a day without each other
Cons:
-if she doesn’t join me, all of the cons from 2
-if she does join me, I have caused the death of the love of my life
-if she does join me, she may only be joining me because she feels obligated to
-she may not have killed herself if I had instead not allowed her to join me
-she may talk me out of it, forcing me to kill myself at a later date without telling her

I love her so much. She’s the best thing that has ever happened to me. None of these three options are ideal, but I am forced to pick whichever is the least bad.

I would go for 3, as it lets her make her own decision. But I am worried that she may be throwing her life away because of my influence. Or she may not actually be willing to go through with it, and then I am forced to kill myself without her, making the whole thing an even more horrifying experience for her than it would be if I had gone with 1 or 2 from the start.

I did think of breaking up with her. Maybe start an argument over nothing and tell her I never want to see her again. Maybe lie and say I cheated on her. Then I could kill myself and she’d never even find out (we have no mutual contacts). Maybe she would hate me and be able to move on easily. Maybe she’d be happier with her new life without me. I know that this is the right way to do it. But I cannot do it. It wouldn’t be convincing even if I could do it

People dying and getting tortured cause two fucking idiots decided to eat an apple what the fuck is that shitty story. Send me to hell I wouldn’t care if somebody shot me in the face right now I would thank them and shake their hand. I moved from that house I lived in with my mom to where I’m now with my some other relatives. I sit in my room all day because I can’t get used to anything. Not school not talking not eating my whole life shifted. My grandmother was my moms helper during cancer and if she dies anytime soon I’m going next. The only reason I’m still alive is cause of the rest of family and little friends I have. I can’t put my grandma through more pain.,S
955,"And no I'm not. I'm *never* going to find love. I'm into kids.

1) No I have not done anything, nor do even I even want to (we'll get into why later)

2) Don't tell me to 'get help', I'm already in therapy thanks

3) I do not, in any way, support anything sexual between adults and anyone below the age of 18

Alright let's get into it. I'm not sure exactly what I'm into, but it's not sexual. I think it's more romantic. I'm specifically into boys, below the ages of 4 and 9, typically. Yes, it's disgusting and awful, but I didn't choose it and can't change it. The idea of me and a boy holding hands smiling each other in a tropical paradise is what I live for. 

I just... want kids to be happy. I don't ever do anything they don't like while I'm with them, and you will not come across a kid that has met me that won't say I was one of the coolest or funnest people they'll ever meet. 

But this rarely happens. Rarely do I have a chance with a kid, and even when I do. Oh, even when I do. Question: If you were with the crush of your dreams, and you knew that nothing you could ever do would win them over, but that all your other crushes were the same, what would you do? Sure, we have fun, but I know it's only temporary. And when that dreaded parent comes, it's all over. The kid will have to be somewhere with family and will have to come back to their 'friend' later.

I think I'm into the same thing that parents do- that is, just... having fun with them. Cuddles. Tickles. Kisses. Hugs. Just... being with boys. I swear up and down I don't want sex with a kid. I find that repulsive, just as I find sex between two consenting adults repulsive. I have never once been into sex. It's weird, but true. However, because I'm into what parents do, and parents can do it and I can't, I have developed a deep, resounding, all-encompassing hatred for all parents. And it's not just longing- I've had more than one boy taken away from me when both of us were literally just having innocent fun. I *hate* parents. Deeply. If all the parents died horrible deaths tomorrow I'd honestly rejoice. No seriously. I want them off this planet, the same that all you parents no doubt want like child lovers like me off this planet. I enjoy making fun of them and making them feel miserable online.

Imagine, if you saw your boyfriend / girlfriend being dragged away by some stranger, and you could do absolutely nothing about it but sit and watch. Imagine that stranger is one you must seek the permission of whenever you want to find love. And then imagine the stranger abusing the people you have a crush on, and there was nothing you could do about. 

But, hey, *parents know* ***best!!!!*** Bullshit. But I didn't come here to vent against parents, I came here because I wanted to die.

So yeah, I'm never finding love. EVER. Because the really fucking ironic thing is that my interest in innocent fun and aversion to sex makes me harmless around kids, *but completely useless with adults*. In fact, I'm actually a little into girls my age as well (emphasis on *little* but the interest is there), but in terms of girls, I'm completely useless due to lack of sexual tendencies.

I look at kids having fun with their parents and I just... long. Long for something like that, without any parent to fear. Just having fun with a boy, probably 7-8 years old, both of us laughing and enjoying ourselves. Without me constantly having to look over my shoulder or seek parental approval for every slight thing. But such a thing will not happen.

I have never kissed a girl or anyone. I have been on zero dates. I have been in zero romantic relationships. And I fear that it's going to stay exactly that way.

I'm young- still early 20's, and my entire life is ahead, and I have a somewhat promising future. But I want to end it- end it all. I know that however successful a future I end up having, it is a future I will most likely have without a single romantic partner. And what's life without love?

But I'm sure you all want me to die anyways. One less pedo, right?",S

I love my girlfriend and I can’t not imagine spending the rest of my life with her, but I don’t want to be disowned. I love her so much and I want to marry her.

959,"Is the night. I have been fighting suicidality since I was 18 years old. I'm 37 now. I survived incestual abuse for over 30 years. My father had his way with me whenever he pleased while I slept or was passed out in a drug-and-alcohol-induced stupor. Who knew I was protecting myself from knowing?
Well, now I know. And at 35, I began picking up the pieces. I was in therapy usually twice weekly, working on myself and even found someone who will actually ride or die for me. I did the work, but I keep coming back to the only way to really be healed is to die on my own terms. Nothing else has ever been on my own terms. I was completely controlled until my father moved away. I think I finally called him out in my sleep and that's why he ultimately moved hundreds of miles away in 50+ acres. To drink himself to death and get lost in the property. 
I wanted to confront my father for a long time. I thought it would give me healing, but let's be real. He will never admit to the harm he caused me. He will never own up to attending at least 4 interventions after I'd attempted suicide, sitting there and not offering his own sins as a reason why I couldn't stand living. 
I will never forgive him and I don't want to. Maybe that's why I feel at peace despite not ever getting the chance to confront him. He'll know why I did this and if he doesn't, he will be receiving a letter to his post office box anyway. 
The only thing that ever made me feel like I was worth anything was working in veterinary medicine.  Animals understand me better than any human ever could and I tried my best to do the same for them. I even collected 4 dogs and a cat in hopes that my father would leave me alone. The 3rd dog definitely expressed his disgust for my father regularly. I credit him and my oldest dog for keeping me alive for as long as they had. 
No practice manager understood the issue. At my last position, I was finally honest about my PTSD and my discomfort working with males. They hired two men right after they hired me. It was a joke. They loved me and my work ethic but couldn't consult with me or even  consider my aforementioned issue with males before hiring two males within a month of each other. I worked so hard to be okay with it, but ultimately I relapsed and was not okay at all. My friend wrote a note as a receptionist for an internal med practitioner, which she is. My practice manager fired me, claiming she had looked into the note and found it to be falsified. My friend and the doctor who signed it were fully aware of the note. No reason to fire me except you couldn't handle the truth, especially when I was clearly in need of compassion and understanding. 
It is difficult to admit that despite all the work I've put into healing, I couldn't ever get there. But I couldn't. Every time I came close, it all went to shit because it got into me too early. I am sure I was first touched before my 3rd birthday and I don't think the brain can ever heal from that early of a disruption. The neglect and further abuse helped to compound the issues my brain had in formation and growth. 
So, I guess this is hello and goodbye, my friends of this sub. I believe in all of you and I know you can be stronger than I was. I was lucky enough to find someone who loved me unconditionally and I know that means you all can too. And when it gets hard, maybe that person can love you through it. I wouldn't let mine, but he is the only person I would ever want to be next to when I take my last breath. I love you all. Please learn from me and people like Vanessa Gutierrez Toledo. We tried so hard and no one listened hard enough to know what we had on our own was not enough. It takes an actual village. Be that village for each other. And carry with you that it matters how you treat someone.

I’m exhausted and I don’t have much more to give. I don’t want to die but I don’t know how to live. How to fix my life how to get better.

I don’t want to call my therapist because I don’t want him to be mad at me. 

I can’t tell my coworkers because then I’ll just lose my job or they’ll treat me like I’m crazy.

My family and friends have their own shit going on. I can’t keep taking from them.

975,"I almost don't want to post this as my suicide is not urgent by any means. Others are far more deserving of love and attention than I am. I guess I just wanted to get it out there. Finally, open up.

I've been wish I was dead since I was 15. Like everyone I thought it was just a phase. Then those thought never left me. They made me depressed as they went from being an every other week thing to everyday. I fell into a depression at 18 that lasted for years.

It became crippling at 20. Suicide was the only thing on my mind every day. 

Until about 21 when I finally suddenly out of fucking nowhere got the strength to try again. I started exercising and working a job. My interest in everything returned. I felt human again for what felt like the first time in years.

Then

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder II at the age of 22. I'm 24 now and I spent so long trying to prove the doctor and psychiatrist wrong. Even when it finally explained everything in my life. The mood swings. The depression without a trigger. The sudden weeks or solid month of productivity then back to depression. The constant thoughts of wishing I was dead. But I wanted to just be depressed. Ya know? Something I could fix with exercise and therapy. 

I avoided medication and refused to do any more research about my diagnosis as the more I looked the more it made sense and I didn't like that. It hurt every time I saw yet another symptom that fit me to a T.


My family has always been very inconsiderate of mental illness so I didn't want it to be true. I didn't want to be anymore of a burden to my family than I already am as I tried to get my young adult life together.

Then 3 weeks ago from now it hit me. The crash after a long lasting high.

I went from being in the best shape of my life. Running 6-12 miles a day everyday. Working a good manual labor job. Lifting heavy weights 5 days a week. Constantly moving and being productive and making good savings to finally move out, to with in one night being unable to even get out of bed.

I never even realized it. I was hypomanic and just thought I was finally getting my shit together. I thought I was becoming competent but it was just a part of my goddamn mental disorder.

I've missed work everyday since those 3 weeks now. I haven't lifted or ran since then. I haven't left my room unless it's to eat or use the bathroom. And of course I have regained tons of weight from emotional eating. 

In my darkest and saddest moments I can hear voices telling me to kill myself. Those same voices that plagued me at 20 years old. Voices I can't stop or silence.

They tell me I'm a freak, a burden. And they're right. Who could ever love me? I'm mentally ill. Nobody can ever understand. No one will really ever care. 

How could they?

I'm not only mentally ill, I'm a failure. Because so many others function better than I do. Better than I ever could. I read such inspiring stories about those who have overcame there mental illness, those who can persist even when things get dark and I cry. Because I know I never will.

I can't live like this.

I shouldn't be alive. I shouldn't have been born. My family shouldn't have to deal with a failure of a son like me. I can't be cured. I can't be changed.

My plan is to buy a gun. And shoot myself. I know it's not my fault but I can't take this sadness anymore and I cannot live the rest of my life with this sickness. I'm not strong enough.

I don't know when I'll do it but I just don't see myself making it past 27 years old.",S

977,"I am a 21 year old female from South Africa and I’m beyond tired. I cannot possibly become financially stable no matter what I do. I live with my parents but it’s not a good environment. They both need therapy but have forced me to go in place of them since I was 18 months old. Yes. A literal baby in therapy before I could even speak. I cannot make this up. I have a colossal amount of childhood trauma. I’ve tried leaving before at 19 and my parents and extended family had me locked up in an illegal christian cult camp for what was supposed to be a year but I got out in half of that for “good behaviour”. I could have had them all locked up but they are friends with powerful people and I knew it would never work. I don’t feel comfortable even speaking on what was done there or to me. I came back to live with them in fear of being kidnapped and locked away again. I went through hell. Since then I have worked my ass off like you would’ve believe. I have secluded myself and lost every single friend I had because I don’t go out or party or even speak to anyone. The unemployment rate for my age group in my country (15-24) is almost 65%. Yes. I cannot just go out and get a job. I’ve applied for almost 60 corporate jobs in the past 2 years and didn’t get any of them. I have tried selling things I own but it’s the most embarrassing and discouraging experience constantly being spoken down to on marketplace or getting rejected and having posts up for over a year without any interest. I’ve downloaded every survey app, I try do freelance jobs and I’ve even attempted to do the most humiliating things because I’m so desperate. I paint and sell my work to a nursery near me. I’ve sold blankets that I made myself. I have a tiny part time job with a family member which is my main source of income but it pays almost nothing. And many more things. I’ve tried so hard. The heartache of having to be so desperate because you know you can’t rely on anyone is something I cannot describe. All of this and I’ve done it with depression and an anxiety disorder. It would be tough for a normal person but as someone with depression it feels impossible to get out of bed. And sometimes I admit, yes, I don’t. But I get up and I try so hard. I’m not lazy. And it’s still not good enough. 1.5 years after I got back from being kidnapped and I only have enough money to pay for an apartment deposit + 3 months rent. No food or other expenses. If you were to exchange that to dollars it would get you a few grocery trips, nothing else. I’ve truly tried everything and there comes a point when you just have to stop beating a dead horse. There’s nothing more I can do. I sleep 25 hours a week. TMI but I haven’t had my period in months from stress, most of my hair has fallen out and I haven’t been the sun in years. I was dealt a shitty card. I’ve worked as hard as I can to get out of it but there’s truly nothing more I can do. Each rejection pushes me closer to the edge. I’m tired of positivity. I’m tired of hope. The world is not fair. It doesn’t owe me anything. I know this. But I’m not strong enough for this anymore. I’m tired of nothing but rejection. I’m tired of being hungry. I’m tired of feeling scared every waking moment. I’m tired. No, I’m not saying I’ll do anything. But this is how I feel.",S
