I'm glad to have my relentless ambition back! I've decided I want to go into political science and eventually law school. My dream is being a state governor. It's going to be a long and hard road, but I'm so excited to begin this journey, regardless of whether I reach the end or not!"

22,"It’s been a rough year for everyone but especially for my mom. Not long after covid started appearing in the US she was diagnosed with brain cancer. She’s had surgery, chemo and is doing very well all things considered. She’s pretty much recovered and is now doing the consistent checks and doctors appointments and tests, which have all been coming back good. 

Both of my parents are retired, social security, disability, etc. fixed income sort of situation. Not much to spend on frivolous things. I’m (30m) an entry level insurance rep for a speciality pharmacy and make decent enough money for a single guy living with his dog, not much but enough. Only been working this position for about a year, which gave me a raise of about $3-$4/hour. 

This year I had managed to save a little more than $1000 and was thinking about how I wanted to spend it. My mom loves Rift, I got her to make a WoW account when I was 12 and she’s been into MMORPGs ever since. It’s been years since she’s been able to play because gaming computers can be expensive and her last one died. 

My dad and I went to bestbuy today after I finally decided what I wanted to get. So I got my mom a asus gaming laptop with 16gb ram, gtx 1660ti &amp; intel core i7. It’s not the best of the best but it will run the shit out of Rift. 

I’m so excited for Christmas now. I wanted to give it to her today but asked if she wanted her gift now or on xmas and she decided to wait. Now I have to hold onto this thing for two weeks and its killing me lmao. 

Seriously, I haven’t been this happy in a long time or excited for future plans and I just can’t freaking wait for her to open it!

27,"I graduated in May from college with a BFA in graphic design. As all of you know, due to Covid, no one was really hiring.

I had two job offers at the beginning of March. The place I worked at as a student asked me to be full-time after I graduated and there was another offer at a local T-shirt company of where my friend worked at. Due to how everyone was new to handling COVID, there were a lot of budget cuts and I was laid off from my student job. They couldn’t afford another full-time person either. The t-shirt company that my friend worked at had to furlough their staff and almost went bankrupt. They too, couldn’t afford another full timer.

I was suddenly back at square one.

After 8 months of searching, I’ve finally landed my first entry-level job! On top of that, it’s in a large marketing and advertising agency - which never really happens for someone who is very fresh like me.

Someone that I knew, who graduated before I did, posted a job opening at her work, and I immediately asked her how I could apply. She gave a very excellent recommendation for me and I got the interviews and was given a job offer. 

For months, I was anxious, sad, and I felt completely worthless.

I was extremely lost.

I had this cloud over my head and I regretted rejecting another graphic design job offer two months ago that had low pay and barely any starting benefits. I knew the job really sucked too due to people I know that worked there.

In the back of my mind, something told me not to take it. I thought to myself that I could find a better job. Super risky move in these pandemic times and my student loan payments were about to kick in, but I was set on doing something better for myself. Either create my small business or get a job. 

Now, I can work from home, get paid +$10,000 more than the other job offer plus with more benefits, and I actually get work that can actually be put in my portfolio for my own professional development.

To those, who are struggling with finding a new job, it might take a long time until you find what you’re looking for. In the moment, it seems like a pipe dream and you feel like you’ll never get there. But I guess as the saying goes, good things will come to those who wait.

TL;DR
I got my first entry level job after 8 months of searching and being sad."

Well I guess we have already been friends for a long time but we haven't talked too much since highschool. I am pretty good at making friends but I've only had like 2 others in my whole life.  Kinda a thought dump but thinking about it is making my night.

After losing my job and doing covid gigs outside my major (still am), I started playing more video games.. then warzone dropped. He saw me on and we found out he and another dude (who I met a hand full of times in the past) were all really good. During the lockdowns we'd play near half our days away catching Ws. 

Then i got invited to the group chat after a couple months of this. Quickly after me and the aquantiances guy started hanging without my main bud. Even went to his birthday party back home and drank with his party friends. He's been hiting for a while that he wants me to start a podcast/ stream duo games with him. 

Fast forward and the main bud comes back home to my state to have a snowboard trip with one of my few close friends and his buds. Planned all over xbox party chat primarily. It was a blast! W just happen to be on the same level. He told me im his oldest and best friend he's had and it's wild were back in contact after 5 years of light chatter. Now we talk everyday, give either advice, uplift each other in our goals/say wild shit in the group chat, and send memes to one another.

He moved to Hawaii recently tho but says to always hit him up when he visits and expects me to visit sometime. Now I'm planing on visiting him in Hawaii next year where he will host me for a week. Things really do change fast af.. Im happier than I've been in a minute."
41,"Found out today I was accepted into my Masters for next year. I am blown away. I have worked so freaking hard, and have been sick with stress. I started my grad dip in psych 3 yrs ago,  got married, fell pregnant, had a 27 wk preemie, spent 3 months in hospital,  bubba came home on oxygen. She came off in time to attend my graduation. I had a surprise pregnancy (don't judge, precautions were certainly taken) and bubba 2 rocked up this yr, another preemie, putting my studies on hold. The sponsorship/scholarship program I worked so hard to get changed, meaning I had to take time off to have bubba and then reapply, all whilst the study requirements increased. All good, I'm stubborn if not  intelligent. New  prerequisites for future job meant even more study. I can do this I guess. I apply for my Masters, send out my references, sit the interview and I bloody got it. I just want to toot my own horn for the first time ever. I'm almost 35 and have never had a full time wage. I'm about to go into a full time wage paying while I study, and they will pay my Masters too. I am freaking proud of myself. 2 more years baby, and I'll be right where I want to be to provide the best I can for my girls after spending so long living week to week. I've got this."

it feels like a silly thing to be happy over but this was a big step for me in terms of fighting my anxiety too. im proud of myself."

My parents aren’t together and I think that they were putting the responsibility of teaching me on each other (think “if her dad isn’t contributing the. I’m not doing it” mentality). So when I left home to go to college and started living on my own, I had to rely on friends, walking and the extremely limited public transportation. Eventually I got a bike and used for literally everything for 3 years. Disclaimer: biking in the rain and attempting to go grocery shopping on a bike is not fun lmao.

I moved in with my grandparents due to COVID and I was able to learn how to drive, save up, and get my ideal first car! Honestly, having a car feels so surreal. I don’t have to feel like a burden to people when I need to get somewhere. I don’t have to commute 30 minuted on a bike to get to my job that’s literally minutes away. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and just being able to fit everything in my car as opposed to balancing 4+ bags in my bike basket was enough to make me super happy. 

I’m basically at a point where I want to find any excuse to run errands just because I can. I’ve been wanting to get Coffee Bean for like 3 months but didn’t want to ask my grandparents to take me, so as a reward for myself, I’m getting Coffee Bean this morning. 

Sorry for the long post, but I’m just so so happy I can finally drive!"

Ive gone back a few times. I was waiting in line hoping to see her, she delivers the car infront of mines food. I had not seen her so I thought I was SOL again. She turns around and I call out her name.

She comes back to my car and she remembered who I was.

I straight up asked her ""This is probably super unprofessional but, youre cute as hell, ***To which she thanked me for the compliment***  ""and Id love to get to know you more or take you on a date.""

She asked me if i wanted her number to which I said hell yeah. I texted her as soon as I got home and am waiting for her reply. She did say she was tired and has to work tomorrow.

137,"Hello!
I just thought I'd share something positive and heart warming in the middle of this whole Corona mess. 

My family has obviously been keeping up with the elderly in our extended family during all this to make sure they're doing ok. Firstly, my grandpa who doesn't quite understand what's going on and is almost refusing to stay inside. I've been getting him the newspaper and delivering it to his mailbox every other day (he really cares about reading it in his regular schedule haha) and we've been grocery shopping for him etc anytime he needs. This has proven fairly easy since he lives close to me. 

Secondly my grandma, who I was a bit worried about. She lives about two hours away from the rest of us in a pretty rural town here in Sweden, so going to run errands for her would not have been as easy. Anyhow, I call her to see how she's doing and make sure she has what she needs and I am now convinced her town is the best town to live right now if you're in a risk group. She tells me that she hasn't gone out in a week (now 3, this was 2 weeks ago) and that her grocery store and pharmacy started delivering food and medicine free of charge for everybody in town. Also, her retirement group came by with yarn for her so she could knit. So she was in the best mood saying she's been keeping busy with housework and talking on the phone to her best friend across the street while they sit in their windows looking at each other. All this just really warmed my heart and to me showed how people are really looking out for each other right now, so I thought I'd share."

I did not feel confident about myself at all, and I would constantly compare myself to others, and think “Why can’t I be like them.” I knew what was wrong, but I guess I didn’t care enough to fix it. Or something like that. Maybe I didn’t know how to fix it. I’m not sure. In the midst of all of that, I found a love for physical activity. It all started with that 100 push up per day challenge a couple years ago. I took that, and I began to work out more. I was a VERY skinny kid, just skin and bone really. I even had a muffin top going on... a little while into that, I finally drummed up the courage to ask out the most amazing woman a man could ever ask for, and she said yes! I still had no self confidence, low self esteem, and I would often get upset that I was not like others that I thought were ‘better’ than me. It took me a long time to realize that she loved ME and not what I thought I was supposed to be. Later on in our relationship, during last summer, I got myself a job that I absolutely love (my first one, and I still work there). Recently, I have finally dropped / am working on all of my bad habits and my perception of myself. Working out has given me self confidence (but I do not rely on it and I am perfectly fine with the body I have now) and my amazing girlfriend has given me the motivation I needed to get off my lazy ass and turn my mindset around, and for the first time in a very very long time, today I feel confident!

I just got the mail for today and there was a letter from my bank. Enclosed was a check for 800$ for a gap insurance refund for my first car I totaled nearly 8 years ago. I am speechless I dont know what to think. I know it's not the case but i can only put it on my mom looking down and knowing i needed help. I knew nothing about such a refund or that I was owed anything. I mean gap insurance is to pay off your loan when you cant pay it so why would I be owed money? I'm in tears and just thanking her over and over and the universe too. I guess I had some good karma or something or maybe luck but I just needed to talk to someone about it.

A study published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision found that people who use their cell phones at work after 9 p.m. feel more pressure the next day than people who carry a smartphone to work the next day. The reason is simple: processing work and responsibilities before bedtime makes it harder for the brain to shut down and almost impossible to relax in our dreams altogether.

236,"I am celebrating my latest idea that I am positive will bring me, and others, happiness! I work graveyard shifts and found that depression comes very easy as graveyard shift workers voluntarily resign half of their social life for work. We can not hang out with friends late at night partying and we can not join others half the time during the day because we must sleep during the day.

My brilliant idea is a local graveyard shift group! We meet up after our shifts and have food and drink like normal day shift workers do. The result is an improvement not only in my life, but others with a similar fate. Not really a help group, but we certainly will. Its more to regain some normalcy in our lives and make friends that find themselves in a similar situation.

I called around to poll to see if it was a good idea and if night workers would come. I just got off the phone with a lot of them and every single response was very positive! I just cried tears of joy in this discovery.  I had to share. I want to scream it from roofs and mountaintops. Just the prospect in this moment and its future possibilities MAKE ME HAPPY!

Now I am giddy with excitement to find a locale to host us regularly. What fun. Here's to a bright future to look forward to! I wish the same for all..."

""realistic""). For what feels like forever, I couldn't find any tutorial that would make the kinda terrifying experience of making said home + mod a little less, well, terrifying, but I finally did, and I'm ecstatic! 

I wish I was joking but I just became so overwhelmed with happiness over changing the model of a large item I needed inside the house to something different and smaller than the original so that it would better fit inside that I flailed my arms around lol. I thought another modder that did something similar was a wizard, and that I'd have to go into like, 3D modeling software and pick apart the game files but nope, it was as easy as just changing the model in the program that helps create the mod/home. 

Nobody else really cares about this kind of stuff around me, so I just had to share it with someone. Figured this was the best place to do it, even if only one person sees it! 

Go me! I'm going to have the **best** house in the (game) world now (to me anyway, because I made it myself, with a lot of TLC and troubleshooting). :D"

Recently, I went through a split in a relationship and ended up stranded in Indiana when my partner refused to drive me back to my home. I was really desperate and called my brother and both him and my sister drove 6 hours there and 6 hours back to pick my snotty sniffling self up. We had a few heart to hearts in the car and I really feel like we're moving in the right direction!"

So this is an update on my previous post.

My grandmother had her 95th birthday yesterday, and I left giving her all your cards today as I believe most of the cards have arrived now.

I know theres likely some still to come in the post, which ofcourse she will enjoy just the same! 

She absolutely loves seeing all these cards, I read each one individually out to her and showed her. 
 I did get many stories about places that you live in that she had visited! 

She wanted to thank you all so much for making an old lady feel so young and special during her birthday. She was so pleased that you all bothered to write to an old stranger! 

If anyone included their return address, I will write back to you thanking you individually. 

There was so many, I wont be able to write a reddit message back to you, so please thank you so much

My lips were always awfully red from the thin skin (not in a nice way). If I didn't pick my lips, I scratched my scalp or at my skin.

I don’t remember many specific events from childhood. I mostly remember places and people, But there are a few fights between my parents that I remember well.

My dream has always been having a true life partner. I’ve had half a dozen or so relationships. One of them, the 2nd one, would’ve been exactly what I wanted had I not pushed her away out of fear. She was the only one that I initiated the break up with. All of the others broke up with me. Most of them cheated on me. The last relationship was the hardest. As I unraveled each of her lies it became clear that I was partially at fault for what happened. I realized that she treated me poorly because I let her do it. 

I’ve been out of that relationship for 2.5 months. Every day since leaving has been better that the day before it. My entire outlook on life is changing. I’m starting to see opportunity and abundance everywhere. Over the past few days I’ve realized that I am an awesome person.

He listens to me. He doesn’t judge me. He makes me feel safe and comfortable, but he gives me space when I need it. I’m not used to that. I’m so glad I get to share this experience with him. 

We’ve both had hard days. Who hasn’t? But man, being able to face them with someone healthy in your corner is... incredible. 

And for as much as I wish we’d met in happier times, when we could laugh and get out and enjoy things the old way without this constant heaviness in the air, I’m just so grateful that it happened at all."

I'm hairy noon and night

I'm hairy high and low
Don't ask me why
Don't know
It's not for lack of bread
Like the Grateful Dead
Darling

Gimme head with hair
Long beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming,
Streaming, flaxen, waxen

Give me down to there hair
Shoulder length or longer
Here baby, there mama
Everywhere daddy daddy

Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it

Let it fly in the breeze
And get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas
A hive for bees
A nest for birds
There ain't no words
For the beauty, the splendor, the wonder
Of my...

Shining, gleaming, streaming
Flaxen, waxen
Knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, flowered, and confettied
Bangled, tangled, spangled, and spaghettied!

Oh say can you see
My eyes if you can
Then my hair's too short

Down to here
Down to there
Down to where
It stops by itself

They'll be ga ga at the go go
When they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond
Brilliantined
Biblical hair

My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah I adore it
Hallelujah Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?

Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair

Since I was 14 years old I have struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide. Even during times when I wasn't depressed, I thought about killing myself, so I had always sort of figured I wouldn't live past 25. That the regularly resurfacing battle with ending it all would somehow have won.


Yet here I am, 26 years old today. I have some really, really excellent friends who love me and care about me and make effort to show it; I have been able to live out experiences that I never would have dreamed I'd get to do; I have hurt, and I have healed; I have danced with strangers in the rain; I have seen sunrises I will never forget and sunsets that will never fade from my mind; I even saw a total solar eclipse.


The world has so many beautiful things in it, and I can feel that in my heart even when I'm not able to see them. To be alive is the greatest gift I have ever been given, and I'm so thankful that I didn't lose it in a weak moment.

I am a person, who requires alot of structure in my life, so being home all day affected me in a bad and potent way. I've been struggling for over a year to find the structure I needed, and it was very difficult.

I am overweight (although not nearly as big as I used to be) so every class is a struggle. And every night I overcome that struggle through sheer will.  It's given me confidence, purpose, and structure. I've also started to eat well again and getting my diet back on track. 

Last night, I was about to go to sleep when my fiancee said to me ""you're different, somethings different with you somethings better"". I smiled at her, and instantly knew what she meant.

In February I got my gallbladder removed. 

My hospital identifies as a charitable organization. All throughout diagnosis (doctors &amp; tests) I received self-pay/non-insured discounts that varied from 25% to 80% off of all those bills. My balance (for JUST the hospital bill - not surgery, tests, diagnosis - just what they charge for someone to be in the OR with all the support staff) was *not* applicable for a self-pay/non-insured discount. However, the hospital does offer financial assistance to those in need, like myself, so I applied. 

I hadn't heard from the hospital in over a month, so I called them today. The woman on the phone told me that my balance was, *get this* \- 

# $36,635.93

Holy shit, right? 

I was obviously shaken before she even finished her sentence... BUT!!! Because of my income, the hospital forgave 100% of that whole bill. I owe them ZERO DOLLARS! 

In total after the doctors, tests, and hospital bill, my total amount for the surgery hovered around $38,000. 

Because they forgave the hospital bill &amp; I paid some of the charges upfront, I only have $1,000 in debt with them! AND AND AND they let me pay whatever dollar amount I could afford each month. I have 4 bills, and I'm paying them each $50/month. In 5 months I will be completely medical debt free! 

So yeah! That's it! I thought my credit and financial life was going to die this year because of this surgery and the fact that I am uninsured living in the United States, but IT ISN'T! 

Quick add; if you're unfamiliar, PLEASE look into hospitals that identify as ""non-profit"" or ""charitable organizations."" This will save you from losing everything if you're like me and are uninsured and very poor!!"

They've also caused a lot of suffering, though, and I was put on them out of prejudice and discrimination from my shitty parent and doctors.

I wanted to feel heard, accepted, and understood, but I wasn't, and the doctors weren't competent. I'm now 21, suffering from masturbation-induced adrenal fatigue during \~4 years of massive growth and recently figured out the drugs are why I haven't been able to recover and what have caused the problems I've been experiencing for so long: Depersonalization, altered perception of time, changed level of consciousness, emotional blunting, brain fog (at least partially), and various health problems.

Once I secretly wean off of them enough to have the cognitive performance to learn and implement hostage negotiation tactics to deal with my parents (and possibly the psychiatrist), I'll be able to get off them, make much more progress in life, and move to a major city instead of a bumfuk town!"

I’m ready to go to the gym tomorrow and make a real change. I’m ready to go to college in two weeks and finally earn something more than GCSEs after 2 years of dropping college and sixth form. It feels like somehow, somewhere, a huge weight has been lifted off my back. 

Yesterday I spoke to my oldest sister over a phone call for the first time in half a year. It was a huge leap of faith. I had no conversation topics pre thought up, no alterations to my language, no trying to be the best. I’d seen a sentence about dancing, how if you just focus on feeling it instead of thinking of the steps in your head, it works. And it worked. And we spoke for 2 and a half hours, effortlessly just talking. I haven’t  had a conversation like that in years, where I’ve just been able to relax. 

I can’t put it into words at all. All I can say is when something happens that’s incredible, I’ll be adding it to this post. Whether it’s a week, month or year from now. I love you all."

Then covid happened and everything seemed even more hopeless. I was depressed and feeling very lost; I was even thinking about giving up music to pursue something easier with better pay. Then I was spontaneously offered my dream job by a mentor I once had. No application or interview, because they believed in me that much. All I had to do was sign the contract. I'm pretty young and inexperienced, but they have so much faith in me. That has to mean I have some value, right?

I start this week, and so far I have gotten to work with and form a colleague relationship with this person, who has been my idol for a decade. They inspired me to become a musician and pursue my dreams in the first place. I feel like I couldn't even dream up a better scenario for myself. I am just over the moon. My existence feels meaningful and validated. What do I even do with all of this gratitude??

536,"I'm an Italian volounteer working in France for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent.

They're mostly migrants from Africa and Arab countries that need housing, getting regular documents to legally stay in the country, finish their studies and find a work.

Due to Covid we didn't do many activities and we were left with some extra budget, so we decided to spend it for a trip, and yesterday we brought them to the beach. We were a dozen: seven teenagers from several african countries, three from Pakistan, me, and an educator. As soon as we arrived we immediately went into the water.

Me, being a little thin and suffering the cold from the water more than other people, got out earlier than the others and went back where we left our stuff. Not a minute after I got there, a guy came to me asking something. It went like that:

Him: Are you supervising that group there? (pointing at my young ones playing in the water)

Me: Yes

At that point I expected some kind of bad remark. And instead.

Him: We are leaving tomorrow, and I wanted to give you this to spend for getting them ice creams

And he lent me a 50 euros banknote. I didn't really know what to reply on the spot, and just told him a ""thank you"", very surprised. He didn't wait for more, and just left. He had his towel a little further, he packed his stuff, was joined by who I guess were his wife and daughter, and went away.

He didn't ask if I was working for some association, who the young ones I was supervising were, nothing. He didn't even wait for giving the money when everyone was present. He just made this selfless act and departed.

On the way back we bought everyone ice creams and I ended the day with a really great feeling. I think it was the nicest, most spontaneous thing I ever happened to see from someone."

I yelled come dance and the little girl did. It was magical. He sang You’re my angel to us.

Have had a plan to celebrate my birthday this week to make up for the fact I didn’t have a proper 21st, and I don’t want to drunk text my friends and think this appreciation is only out of being under the influence. But I just want everyone to know having friends who genuinely support you and want to see you succeed is so amazing. I NEED the best for all of my friends period. Knowing I have the support from them as well in whatever venture I take is so heartwarming. 

Get friends who are confident and are confident in you. 

It’s so nice being at peace with yourself knowing you have a group of people who want the best for eachother. It takes a while to find these people but cherish it. I used to never see a point to life and wanted to end it all for the longest amount of time because I didn’t see a point… and I can see where people come from in hopelessness, give it time you will find your people. You will find your group that all supports eachother. You will find meaning to keep going, you may not find the reason but you will find why and who to keep going for to support them and to have them support you is amazing. Just give it TIME. I really never thought I would find this point in my life but man does it feel amazing to regret every single negative thought about life I ever had. I hope everyone finds this. I want everyone to reach this point of appreciation towards who they have in their life.

575,"So basically last year I was feeling a bit low. I really didn’t know how to become better since I had never faced this before. I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety. So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then. I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same .

The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend. The app also has a ""Find Therapist"" feature using which you can contact our therapists for help.

576,"This afternoon my boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) found out we would be on our schools homecoming court, and it felt so surreal! I had to keep looking at the announcement post over and over to make sure I wasn’t dreaming! For some context, we’re both seniors and were one of four couples most voted out of around 12+ couples! It makes me really happy, because I’m a shy, mostly introverted kid, and I have a lot of social anxiety, and it’s just really good to have a sort of…validation from my peers, you know? Although I also owe a lot of it to my boyfriend, he’s really outgoing and charming, I don’t think I could’ve ever gained the confidence to do this without him! I’m super excited for the homecoming game now, I’m determined to make my senior year the best yet!

It’s funny too, we were supposed to find out who was on the court last Friday, but due to technical issues (they left one of the couples off the ballot) and ties (apparently four couples tied for second place! Isn’t that crazy?!) we had to revote today! I was anxious my entire class after voting, but it felt so good to see our names there!

If you don’t mind me getting mushy, I really appreciate my boyfriend a lot and am so excited to get to do this with him. We both had really bad previous relationships, and it was something we bonded over. He treats me so well, he likes to show me off, is always loving to me, and I can tell him anything! I can’t express just how much I appreciate him, because I really do. He even bought me a froggy bucket hat that he gave me earlier today! Honestly, my day has just been really amazing, and I hope yours is too!"

I was doing ok for a while and even got selected to work a more advanced workload after several months. Then the pandemic happened and I've been thrown all over the Agency, I'm thankful they kept me employed while collections was halted, but it derailed my learning progression. I've been worried a lot recently about my productivity since coming back to collections, I need ground up re-training to function at this point.

Then a miracle happened, my Team Leader announced to us that a different department is expanding and will be filled by officers in my current role. I put my name in and I've been accepted. I don't know when I start training, though it will be sooner rather than later they say. The bottom line is, I finally get to leave collections.

I dont like being with anyone I'm like just a sad person who can't handle life well. Even I kinda hate my family as they literally can't understand me and always I'm called demon or monster or someone who cant fit in like im from another country. So I cry, I cry alot but there is one girl who has appeared in my dreams more than 5 times. The last one was like 3 days ago. Let me describe her she is a girl about my age nearly 17 she always appears in yellow sweater with texture like in picture and she wears jeans mostly blue. My dream is like she is just standing in empty space like i cant see far away and I'm always on my knees and all I do is hug her by stomach with my face on her stomach and cry and she just like an angel caresses my head holds me tighter while i cry and just tells me everything will be alright. So to the angel in my dreams THANK YOU, you are the only one who understands me and hold me man I cant tell you how much you mean to me. Thanks for saving me over and over again. I just want to meet you and show you my strong side. I cant thank you enough.

I’d been out of work for over a month after losing my job to the pandemic, and was only a few weeks out from being in serious trouble.Stopped to change out of my heels, and got a phone call. 

It was a recruiter telling me I’d been successful for a job I’d interviewed for, that I thought I didn’t have a chance in hell of getting. It’s my dream job, started the following week, and was a 40% pay increase to the job I’d lost from COVID. After I accepted and hung up, I was so overwhelmed that I let out a quiet (but not inaudible) squeal, and started going for the front page of r/humantippytaps . 

To the lady who saw me jumping and squealing in an alleyway by myself, I must have terrified you!

This is my first post on Reddit, not sure if I'm posting in the correct community even. I'm just looking for some guidance on how to approach this toxic mindset that is doing me no good.

Basically, I've become increasingly envious/jealous of certain people, and the blessings they've been given. I recognise that everyone has their hardships and majority of the time I only hold their life in high-regard because I'm seeing the highlights of their life. Which is fine; I accept that with social media very few people are going to be their authentic selves online. But I feel a lot of my problems are rooted in me wanting others not to have something good - if I see someone with a happy relationship, rather than just wanting it for myself as well, I **also** don't want them to have it. If I see someone with a great job offer, I don't want them to have it. If I see someone with a supportive family relationship, I'd rather they don't have it. Sometimes its things that I have myself, but I don't want others to have.

I get triggered everytime I see someone have something that I feel is a blessing, because it brings about deep feelings of envy to the point where I want that thing to be taken away from them.

A key example being a girl on Instagram who posted about her married life being 'amazing' so far. She probably meant well, and she was actually asked about it from her followers so wasn't just an off-the-cuff braggy post. And she seems like a genuinely nice person; always happy to help others and seems sweet in her replies. But as soon as she posted that, I feel so envious of her. I even Googled 'when does the Honeymoon Period of a relationship end?', which came up with a 12-18 month average post-marriage estimate. Then looked at when she got married, timed how long she had left until her Honeymoon Period would start to fizzle out, and felt better about myself that she was past the 12-month mark. Insane, I know. And it feels me with deep sadness typing that out, because that is just one example of many. I probably do something like this every 1 to 2 days. Again, insane.

This is why I came to confine in the lovely community of Reddit. What do I even do with myself? I genuinely want to be happy for others. I know I have a lot to be happy about in my life, and even where I have problems (like every other human), I want to work on them rather than wanting others to have the same/similar issues in their life. But I want to start with being able to look at someone's life, and be truly happy for them, and to want whatever blessing they have to increase. How do I go about doing so?"

710,"The title is pretty self-explanatory.

Just to clarify, she's not like a CELEBRITY, but I don't know what else to call her. She used to sing in a band that was once quite popular in this area, but has since disbanded and she's now a bit off the radar.

She's a bit older than I am, but we've had this cool communication over the messages through the years, which started by me hitting her up as a fan, but has since grown to become quite friendly.

We live a bit far apart, but I'm going to travel close to her soon, so I decided to (bravely) hit her up and ask to meet her, to which she said yes and was really, really nice.

Like, don't get me wrong, it's not a date or anything, but I'm really excited, because her music really helped me through the years, inspired my own works and I've followed her for a very long time, since she seems like a really fun, interesting and awesome person - and I can't wait to have the privilege to have a few drinks with her.

Due to her low radar status, I'll respect her and not share her identity here, just so it doesn't cause an awkward situation or ruin anything.

I'm excited, happy and I hope she turns out to be na awesome person!"

Afterwards I went up to him and I told him about it, I suggested that he might want to consider wearing gel or a bun/braid cause at times I couldn't see his face. He said ""Oh I considered it but I don't think a bun looks good on me"" I told him ""Well I'd rather look at your handsome face than look at your hair the whole time!"" I saw that he was surprised. He blushed and he kind of stuttered out a ""Oh okay. Thank you. You just made my day."" as he let out a shy smile. It was cute :)"

732,"When I was 17 I got a very deep depression and had to leave school due to bullying. 

with alot of therapy and my mom help I got into the night school to complete the 9th grade. Did 2 years and I finished it all except for math. Had to do another year in another school just for that.

Then I decided to do night school again for the 12th grade for 3 years. It was the time of it.

I went to literal hell in this past years for it and never felt better.

I had to deal with a narcisistic mother, a family that blamed me for something nasty I didn't ask for, , a suicide attempt, losing jobs I wanted, unemployment, had to deal with idiots, my own depression that still makes me stay in the couch all day, and a freaking pandemic. 

This school year my job let me go and I decided to go get my yearly social security checks and stay home to study and rest. 

I almost failed the second year but turned it around and was actually the 1st one to finish everything. This year I made question of doing the same.

Had an intership also that I finished with a 17 score!
And the lady of the intership told me I might get a 9 month internship in another hotel cause she sees me with a great future! 


Did 2 school events with my class but I got to take the rains (misspelled I know xp)


6 years ago I was depressed and didn't left my house and never thought I could do much. 

Now I am 24 and feel like I can do almost anything I put my mind into and I an in therapy and trying to be the best me I can be. My next battle will be losing weight and move out! :)"

Im very happy and not looking for any recommendations on how to make friends but I really only have reddit to share this with to be honest and I am really feckn proud of myseld so have to out this out in the world. I left school early but I have always been a hard worker. In my 20s I worked very hard and saved for me and my two boys. I focused on the industry I was in and looked for ways to make a future for us in this industry. I got myself two QQI's over the last 3 years which are like education awards in Ireland. Anyway , lads, I finished my first degree today! My first bloody degree. I have achieved something that will look great on a cv and I did it. I studied, I was exhusted in the nights after work and getting home and feeding the kids, taking to them, playing board games and putting them to bed but I just did it. I did it every night for two years. I studied and excellent and I could not be prouder of myself..

For a long time I have always wanted to try to cook, but I have always been so intimated by recipes and feeling like I can never cook that or this... So I decided the other day I wanted to start simple nothing crazy like a four course meal that would be serves at a 5 star restaurant with a complicated recipe. So I decided I wanted to try and cook roasted root veggies it just sounded so good. Plus also a healthy snack/lunch to bring to work with me &lt;3

Ingredients used: Gold Potatoes, zucchini, baby carrots, mushrooms 

Cut all into 1 inch sizes and mixed with extra virgin olive oil with a little bit of salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.

I really wanted to share I don't have many people in my life to talk about this accomplishment I made today I am so happy I cant stop smiling I am so proud of myself and I proud to myself that **I CAN do this WHEN I MAKE IT SO!!** I know this isn't the most crazy and extravagant recipe and it may not mean anything to anyone besides myself, but I am so proud of myself that I did this today and I wont lie I am a little emotional because I never thought I could do something like this. I am just so proud of myself all together and want to keep going. Sorry if this is long but I wanted to share.

823,"I’m just really grateful.

My boyfriend (21M) and I (20F), have come a really long way in our relationship. He has matured a lot, and I’m happy to support him. I realized a lot of his passive behavior and immaturity came from depression he didn’t want to identify with. I made the choice to stay, and I thought the healing already started last year, but I realize it’s actually happening now. 

I was 300 pounds  and an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic as of last December. I’m now 230, and working out daily to now turn left over fat into muscle. I’m doing really well in college, have my cat Tinkerbell living with me, and gratefully unemployment has been keeping me a float. I plan on moving to another state with my partner, or without, to continue my dream of joining a trade school. 

I dance more often now. I have cut off nearly every friend I had in high school, as well as my boyfriend from his own group, because growing up meant realizing some people didn’t want to see you succeed. Gratefully, unemployment has given us thousands of dollars while our families are helping support us to stay a float in these troubling times (but trust me I’m looking for work everyday.) I can move all by myself and still be okay, and pay my own bills now. I have old friends who had been actual bullies, who still have nothing. And realizing those people didn’t belong in my life, made me the woman I am today. I’m just grateful to not be rude or degrading like they are. I’m just grateful I left the mix of things, because 2 years ago I was depressed and crying daily that I missed them so much. It was so much better to let go, because I’m much slimmer, smarter, faster, and I just... I’m flying. 

And now I have thousands saved, a stronger bond with the current love of my life, and soon a career to start. 

I’m just happy. Of course my relationship needs work, because we’re both always going through changes and we’re young. And working out with my health and body image isn’t always easy every day. But I am happy. I have my love, life, and family, and my kitty. I’m just happy. I’m grateful. And I hope everyone else becomes happier in these tough times too."

847,"Life is good right now for us: We buried St. Joseph in the ground in hopes of selling my 1000 foot house which has gotten too small for us. As a family of 6, who knew the kids would grow, acquire more space, and eat more food?! Plus we will be moving in with my in-laws so a house large enough to accommodate all of us would be difficult to find. Now we've always been practicing Christians, and we teach to pray not only when you need something, but also in thanks. We prayed for our house to sell and for an offer we made on a bigger house to be accepted. They had to happen at the same time, or else the offer would fall through if my house was not also sold. So what happened? As I buried St. Joseph and prayed, a flock of geese flew over me headed towards the south. I felt at peace, sitting in the grass with the sunset just peaking over the horizon. I went back into the house and I kid you not, my phone rang. We had several offers on our house and our dream house accepted our offer!! It was, and still is, a very surreal moment for us. If you are religious and you are reading this, God is good. If you are reading this and you are not religious, God is real. I don't want to make this post about religion but I wanted to give my advice. Be greatful. Love your spouse, cherish your kids, and enjoy the moments that make up what we call life. If you are in a bad situation, work your butt off to get out of it. God helps those who help themselves. Don't accept bad people into your life. We are not here very long. I am 43 years old with 4 kids. Yesterday I was 4 playing with matchboxes in my parents backyard on their retaining wall. If you love what you have, you will never want. Easier said than done, but that is the challenge. I am greatful I get a paycheck every 2 weeks, and I am greatful that, for now, I get to work from home. I am greatful for all the additional time we spend with our kids, whether if be board games, walks, participating in their TikTok videos, or us writing a skit together (or cleaning together) on our youtube channels. Every moment is important, and every step is part of a plan. Your life is how it is supposed to be. You are where you need to be in order to grow. Make choices, even difficult ones, to steer your life in the best position to help yourself and others.  -- Mike from CT, USA.

C) I was not eating as much, so I didn’t feel as lethargic.

I then broke the day down.

I went fishing for the first time since the surgery and a friend came with me. She didn’t fish, she just hung out and read a book while I fished. I had company. It was 78 F out. The water was very high, and there was a constant breeze. Not too much sun, ever so slightly interrupted by clouds. I caught four fish, 3 baby striped bass and a snook. Nothing big or spectacular. I hadn’t lost any gear, my knife didn’t get wet. I wasn’t tired afterwards, I didn’t get sunburned, I wasn’t hungry, I wasn’t dehydrated. We were in a semi isolated spot that couldn’t be seen from the rest of the park. I drank a small mango smoothie. I listened to music and laughed. And I was happy. I was filled with a grand euphoria of which I have never known.

I was in bliss.

And I was the next day too. But what happened that 
next day?

Nothing of note. At least to anyone without a habit of over-analyzing.

I rode my bike and picked up a prescription from the pharmacy. I rode my bike through town to pick up some soap. I realized I left my card at home and went back to get it. I returned and bought my soap and came home. A suture from surgery fell out of my mouth. Nothing happened that was out of the ordinary. And yet this day I felt such peace and happiness.

These past two days have been the best I’ve experienced in the past 6 years of my life. I have never    Felt such peace and bliss. And I don’t know why. If it wasn’t the little things, what was causing such joy within me?

Maybe such a pure and meaningless joy is somewhat foreign to me in recent years. That’s okay, I suppose. I’m happy. And I haven’t felt this good in so long.

I never want it to end. It will, but that won’t stop me from trying.

Thankfully this happiness bout has come about right after... something. I genuinely don’t know how to describe what happened.

Remember aforementioned friend? Maybe a couple of weeks before the last couple of days she said “you are tired, aren’t you? You seem, like, hollow. Full of static.” I asked what she meant and she said, “I don’t know, it’s just like a light in your eyes.” I stood up and walked home. And I don’t know what she meant.

This change of pace is a welcome one. It’s so entirely minor and insignificant. But I’m loving not dragging my unwilling soul behind me."

In her email she said that she misses me dearly, tried to reach out to me over the past years(so did i btw) and that the wants us to be in contact again. You cant belive how happy i am right now."
937,"I was furloughed in April at my job where I made okay money. Although my company was still paying for my health insurance (that alone was amazing enough) there has been no talk of coming back. Making crumbs on unemployment after the extra $600 ended has been extremely stressful and although I saved a lot, I have been dipping into my savings. Last Tuesday I received a call from a different department head saying I was referred to him by my boss and if I’d like to interview for a new role. Long story short, I killed the interview on Thursday and was offered the job Friday! I will be making $5 more an hour and I just can’t believe it. I’m so excited, nervous and scared but I know it’ll all be worth it. I can finally pay off my debt and save more money!!! Covid is still so scary and sad but I’m feeling blessed by the universe."

We’ve had our ups and downs and it seems the ups are far more than the downs. Until recently, our downs were an area of struggle. I am very logical she is very emotional. She’s going a way to connect with me on my level and we’re able to problem solve together. 

If I didn’t have self control I’d wrap my entire body around her while she slept. 

I love her so much! If things keep going this direction, I’m going to put a ring on her."

* **Meditation.** At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I’d clung onto.
* **Yoga.** Please look after your body as well as your life! Follow your internal compass — your intuition. If something feels right, you’ll know. Even more poignantly, like in yoga, if something feels wrong, you’ll know for certain. When you’re practicing yoga, the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment. The practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them.Getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry. There are times to think, but during yoga, you are only required to move, and it requires your full participation.
* **Ritual.** For me, it’s making an afternoon cup of tea. Having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day. It’s best if the ritual is a healthy one, of course (i.e., not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink).
* **Avoid drama and the people who cause it**. Drama is what I call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness. Some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama. My husband and I decided long ago that we weren’t going to tolerate it. We don’t befriend people who bring drama, and we work to keep it out of our relationship. It helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life.
* **Try to maximize time spent on activities that induce «flow.»** Flow is the term for that magical time when you’re so immersed in what you’re doing that you don’t really notice the time passing. We are happiest when we are in flow. So when you do something and realize this is happening, make a mental note of it, and try to build time into your days for similar activities.

973,"Was having a weird off day, wasn’t feeling like myself. So I went to my moms grave to feel better like I usually do when I’m feeling down. Lost her when I was 15, I’m 20 now, the 5 year mark is next week. As I’m sitting writing in my journal, there was some rustling in the tree line maybe 20 feet away. A mama deer appeared followed by her 2 babies, like my mom with my younger brother and I. They curiously watched me for a few minutes, ate something, then slowly walked off. I hope they’re blessed and are safe. They made my day, thank you universe. The sun is just now shining through clouds as I’m typing this, hope everyone is happy today."

So this month, I have 3 paydays, which means an extra huge paycheck that does not have to go towards anything! Second, because of recent changes and refunds to my insurance I don’t have an insurance bill  month either, which means *EVEN MORE* money in my pocket! On top of all the other streams of income I have coming in. 

And damn, it feels sooo good to have so much  money and to spend money, and well, to have such a happy relationship with money. 

I love me some money:) 

What would you all do if you had all your bills paid, many very healthy savings accounts, a hefty cash stash, and en entire paycheck to blow? I want this to be fun and happy so spending is the name of the game, what are you buying?!?"

I think this is a pretty common thing, and I know I've experienced it before when I was younger. 

Well, tonight I was that guy. I was swimming across a lake and on my way back there were some kids on a paddleboard, and after I jokingly said I was a shark they tried to run me over with their board so I played that game with them as the sea monster. It sounds a lot less wholesome than it was, but everyone had a lot of fun and it made me realize that in a lot of ways I'm becoming the sort of person I looked up to when I was younger."
