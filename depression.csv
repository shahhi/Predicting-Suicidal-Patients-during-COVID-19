"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",NS
"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

*****

We'd also like to draw your attention to our reformatted rules at  /r/depression/about/rules, which we soft-launched a few months ago.  As part of that, we developed two detailed wikis with lots of reference information.  

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance on how -- and how not -- to offer help and support here.  

YSK that the types of rule violations that cause us the most trouble here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule.  You should never trust *anyone* who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here.  See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact 

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity.  The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.  

* General-interest posts, or posts about causes or issues.  All these are either off topic (rule 1) or activism (rule 10).  

* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts.  This is an expert-free zone -- that's what *peer support* means (rule 5).  We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions.  Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.  

* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses.  Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.  The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",NS

"I genuinely hate this time of the year. It is so fucking stupid. Everyone is fake nice and happy, pretending like everything is perfect and wonderful. It's dumb and I just want to be left alone.

Edit: I have never had a good Christmas and am in no contact with my family. Currently, I am living with my in-law because COVID fucked me over financially, and he had decided to host Christmas day (I lost my healthcare management job in long-term care because we lost almost all our residents causing the company have no money and had a bad miscarriage right after losing my job that resulted in surgery and not being able to work for a minute). I don't want to sit and have these fake pleasantries with people I don't know.",S
"I can’t feel anything but irritability and sometimes sadness. I can’t express shit. i hate myself and everything that I  do. I just wanna fast forward to my funeral and get this shit over with. I feel bad for elementary school me, he would be so disappointed in what i turned into. He had so much life and potential and now I can’t even get out of bed or have any positive thoughts. I’m fucking tired man.",S
My college sends out these super fake sympathetic emails every time a student dies about how much of a tragedy it is and how that student made such a big impact on their community and how great their personality was etc etc. Tbh one of the biggest reasons I’m not going to kill myself before graduation at least is so that they don’t send one about me. I’m sure they’ll have a hard time finding anything to write lol.,S
"I’m not trying to change because I like who I am, I just get exhausted by people not liking who I am. How does anyone deal with this ? It’s like I have to choose between hating myself and being more likable or loving myself and being disliked by most people. For example .. my boss doesn’t like me much because I don’t laugh at their jokes… I could fake laugh but I feel disgusted with myself",NS
"I almost called a helpline but I’m not actively suicidal and there aren’t really free resources for if you’re just having suicidal ideation. Idk what I would even say but I just want to talk to anyone and maybe get out of my head, know that other people are real. I want to reach out to my boyfriend or my friends or family but I don’t feel like I’m bad enough to bother them and wake them up, especially since I’ve already been a lot to deal with lately.",S
"You would think the older a person gets, the more meaning they would find in life. For me, it's the opposite. Nothing to me seems meaningful enough to spend time on. As a result, the days just go by wasted. I don't enjoy anything. I don't know how to have a conversation. I am lucky to have a good job but I don't fit in there. I don't fit anywhere. I'm 24 and it will only get worse as I get older. My memory is shit and I can barely get through the day. If you asked me to recall what I did yesterday I can't even tell you. I have very few memories of my own life. I have no social meaningful social connections. I feel anxious and paranoid when I'm in public. I wish there was a way to take a pill and wake up the next day feeling like I had something I was passionate about, like a cause or a hobby. I have some hobbies like playing guitar but I just get frustrated way too easily and I never feel passionate about them. Instead I just go through the day thinking negative thoughts even though I know that I am wasting time and energy. My focus is shit and this post is all over the place. I don't feel competent at my job at all. It's a technical job and I am not particularly intelligent. I always have the urge to go out and join some kind of group but whenever I'm in public everything feels like shit so I end up just hiding in my hole. And life just goes by.",S
Here I am at 12am crying because I can smell the Doordash delivery girl's perfume on my McDonalds bag and it's a reminder of how I will be lonely forever if I can't/don't change.,NS
Everyday it’s getting harder to love myself or the world. I’ve become darker and darker. I have a lot of passion towards some things but I can’t find any will or drive to do anything. I keep imagining someone will come and shower all the love I need. I can’t love myself. Just plain platonic love.,NS
"Hitting some breaking points when it comes to my mental health, so I reached out to some mental health organizations to see if I could get therapy that's covered under *something* because god damn I've got some shit to work through and no money to fund that myself.

Sent an email asking for guidance on how to find a financially covered therapist.

Lady sent me a link to a map and a list and said that'll help me find someone. The map worked like crap and I couldn't find anything, so I responded (politely) saying as such.

She responds with ""Many of them aren't taking patients, sorry.""

***HOW DOES THAT HELP ME AT ALL?***

How does that help anyone?",NS
"I’m so fucking tired. My depression made me fuck up my early twenties so hard.

I never got my degree. I racked up debt. 

I’m currently living the dream of so many twenty year olds. I have a fiancé, two children, a home and a well paying job that I worked hard to get. 

But my debt is eating up everything after the necessities are paid. I don’t own our apartment. My in-laws and fiancé do. I refuse to marry my fiancé before I get my debt sorted, but I just can’t see an end to it. 

Christmas gifts always hit me hard. I don’t have room to buy, but people expect. Hence I starve myself 3-4 months prior to December to afford some simple gifts.

I can’t feel anything. I’m just numb. Paralyzed. 

If my children didn’t depend on me I’d probably be dead by now. I have no motivation but them. I can barely manage to get out of bed and to the office. My work is taking a toll now too. 

I just wish I could hit “replay” and stay away from some of my dumbest mistakes. As that isn’t an option I’m slowly creeping closer to suicide. Fuck.",NS
Cause I feel like that doesn’t exist. My whole life I’ve felt like since it’s my problem I shouldn’t even bother to tell them and they prolly won’t even care and when I do end up talking ab it I always feel uncomfortable cause I can see that they don’t care!,NS
"I've posted here twice and have been invalidated both times. I just though I'd be nice to share my story. Maybe get some encouragement. Never mind then. I thought tough love wasn't allowed? 

The whole reason I'm posting here is because I get that shit from everyone IRL. 

Is this not a place to talk about our depression? Because I'm pretty sure I can read and this is
 r/depression is it not????",S
"I have been completely numb for the past 9 months. I just don't feel anything. No appetite, nothing gives me joy and I'm afraid that it will be like this always. I am on medication and they do not help at all.",S
"The year started out fine enough, I guess. At least financially. I found $280 at the casino in Vegas and was also making thousands off cryptocurrency and stock market trades. I even saw $75,000 in my account at one point in June, the most money I’ve ever had. I even cashed out most of it at the peak, which was smart. But after financing a car I shouldn’t have bought because everything was gouged to the moon in June and 3 very expensive flat tires my “Platinum warranty” didn’t help with and several months of bad trades, and daily life expenses, I’m back to less than $1000 to my name. Got my rent paid off for the month and after that - nothing. Guess I’ll just illegally sleep in the car that is keeping me trapped and drowning because selling it would likely involve a massive loss. I also owe a ton of taxes I don’t know how I’ll manage to scrape up. Basically, my life is completely fucked and I’m a few weeks or months away from losing everything I cried, stressed and screamed so much for. 2 years of non stop stress for nothing. I hate how I have to live like this but this is the only thing that’s ever been close to working out for me. 

The dead end job path doesn’t work for me because the jobs I qualify for don’t even pay enough for basic housing and I’m tired of busting my ass for a company that thinks I don’t even deserve a roof over my head at night. I can’t possibly imagine anything getting better from here. I’ve been single my entire life. I don’t have any close friends and constantly have to move because I have no sense of stability. I hate how this country is so goddamn expensive that you practically have to be married to be able to afford it, and I’m unlovable so it’s not going to happen. 

So my plan is, if nothing improves by New Year’s Eve, I’m driving this fucking car off a cliff so NO ONE can have it. It’s robbed me of everything and left me trapped. I hate how I need a car to do anything in this damn country but they’re such a money suck that owning one means you’ll always be drowning financially, no matter what type of car you buy. I’ve owned like 10 cars now, no matter what, they always keep me from getting ahead. Im so sick of feeling like a rat on a wheel while these billionaire hedge fund assholes get to sleep at night knowing they’ll never worry about homelessness because they get to manipulate the market in their favor and nothing will be done about it. Every level of our system feels so corrupt that I’m at the point I’d rather die than keep playing their game. I can’t win, no matter what I try, so fuck it, I quit. I did my best to be a good, caring and kind person and the world took full advantage of me. I get robbed and scammed on every fucking level. I’m sick of it. The world can find someone else to bully and reject and rip off and steal from and throw out in the cold. I’m done being their punching bag. The thought of another year on earth with these pieces of shit makes me sick to my stomach. I won’t do it. I refuse. Life just isn’t for me. I seem to fail at everything I do and attempt and I have no will left to keep going, even if it does make my parents sad. I can’t keep suffering for the sake of the people who brought me here in the first place. Either some ridiculous stock market miracle saves me or I’m blowing myself up by driving off a mountain in this fucking overpriced hunk of metal. Good riddance.",NS
"I was recently going through some family photo albums and I saw pictures of myself from when I was like 6mo, 6y, 8y, 14y etc. I'm currently 24 for context. Each time I see a younger version of myself I bawl my eyes out and can't help but feel like I'm looking at a dead person's pictures. I look distantly sad in almost all the photos, and I cry because I'm reminded of my upbringing and the shit I felt I was too young to go through.

Don't get me wrong, I was raised relatively well, both parents present and all, but I always felt weird and alone since I was a child. I'd hide it all behind my academic excellence because that's the only thing those around me made me feel like I'm good at. 

Besides that, I don't think that anyone likes or loves me (even my best friend or my family) because I feel like I cannot be what they want me to be, and so I beat myself up all the time. I'm currently on a spiritual journey that started about 3 years ago and despite the growth in spiritual knowledge, it's made me even more depressed. 

I feel like such a broke and broken failure, a sinner, a noob, a useless piece of shit who is wasting her potential and whose efforts to better herself NEVER seem to work. And when I get this way I ""talk"" to my younger self and I often find myself apologising for not being what she always wanted to be.

I really hate it here but I'm scared to die. It's limbo.",NS
"Daylight savings has killed me. I used to be able to do 1 thing I enjoy after work like go to the gym or for a walk with my dog, but now it gets so dark and cold before I’m even off work. 

I have no motivation recently to go to the gym and I’ve been paying for the damn membership. In summer and fall I would walk there, workout, and walk home. It made me feel fulfilled and happy to leave my house after work (I wfh.) Now I sit in the same spot after work and barely want to take my dog out for a short walk due to the rain. It’s making my depression so much worse. 

How can I force myself to get up and go to the gym? Or should I just be easy on myself during the winter months?",NS
So i am doing business studies in which i have 0 interest. I have no idea why did i choose it. I have always been wanted to join navy. I had a great urge to serve my nation and see each and every street of this world. But things never worked out in my favour. Though that after joining college i would be able to make friends and hang out with them. But all i do at college is sit at a lonely place and listen to music. I feel like this world is not a suitable place for me. I need an escape from this world from this human expectations from everything.,S
